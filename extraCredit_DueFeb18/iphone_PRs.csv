These forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as ""will,"" ""expects,"" ""anticipates,"" ""future,"" ""intends,"" ""plans,"" ""believes,"" ""estimates"" and similar statements. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about Chunghwa's beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Investors are cautioned that actual events and results could differ materially from those statements as a result of a number of factors including, but not limited to the risks outlined in Chunghwa's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Forms F-1, F-3, 6-K and 20-F, in each case as amended. The forward-looking statements in this press release reflect the current belief of Chunghwa as of the date of this press release and Chunghwa undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements for events or circumstances that occur subsequent to such date, except as required under applicable law.This press release is not an offer of securities for sale in the United States. Securities may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an exemption from registration. Any public offering of securities to be made in the United States will be made by means of a prospectus that may be obtained from the issuer or selling security holder and that will contain detailed information about the company and management, as well as financial statements.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTo supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards pursuant to the requirements of the Financial Supervisory Commission, or T-IFRSs, Chunghwa Telecom also provides EBITDA, which is a ""non-GAAP financial measure"". EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income (loss) excluding (i) depreciation and amortization, (ii) total net comprehensive financing cost (which is comprised of net interest expense, exchange gain or loss, monetary position gain or loss and other financing costs and derivative transactions), (iii) other income, net, (iv) income tax, (v) (income) loss from discontinued operations.In managing the Company's business, Chunghwa Telecom relies on EBITDA as a means of assessing its operating performance because it excludes the effect of (i) depreciation and amortization, which represents a non-cash charge to earnings, (ii) certain financing costs, which are significantly affected by external factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and inflation rates, which have little or no bearing on our operating performance, (iii) income tax (iv) other expenses or income not related to the operation of the business. CAUTIONS ON USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESIn addition to the consolidated financial results prepared under T-IFRSs, Chunghwa Telecom also provide non-GAAP financial measures, including ""EBITDA"". The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with another method for assessing its operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of its ongoing operations.Chunghwa Telecom's management believes investors will benefit from greater transparency in referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the Company's operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, the Company recognizes that:these non-GAAP financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered only as a supplement to the Company's T-IFRSs financial measures; these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Company's T-IFRSs financial measures; these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered to be superior to the Company's T-IFRSs financial measures; and these non-GAAP financial measures were not prepared in accordance with T-IFRSs and investors should not assume that the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release were prepared under a comprehensive set of rules or principle. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to Chunghwa Telecom, as they may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not enhance the comparability of the Company's results to the results of other companies. Readers are cautioned not to view non-GAAP results as a substitute for results under T-IFRSs, or as being comparable to results reported or forecasted by other companies.About Chunghwa TelecomChunghwa Telecom (TAIEX 2412,NYSE: CHT) (""Chunghwa"" or ""the Company"") is Taiwan's largest integrated telecommunications services company that provides fixed-line, mobile, broadband, and internet services.

Bryce Thompson, founder of IAMS Foundation""Investing in my community will always be one of the smartest, most valuable business decisions I'll ever make.""Tweet thisAfter receiving hundreds of applications, 10 students were selected and awarded their scholarships with a surprise hometown visit by Thompson himself. The scholarship winners are Jalen Robinson (Morehouse), Tate Toole (Morehouse), Robert Pinkney (Morehouse), Je'Von James Tone (Texas Southern University), Miles Smith (Bethune-Cooke University), Kaleb Perkins (Livingstone College), Daisha Green (Philander Smith College), Taylor Helton (Prairie View A&M University), Ms. Jordan James (Hampton University) and Lindsay Collins (Howard University).Once a struggling student himself, Thompson vowed to one day give back to students facing financial challenges after his uncle generously paid for his first year of tuition. ""I know what it feels like to not know whether you're going to be able to register for the next semester,"" says Thompson, who studied engineering while at Morehouse. ""So, to now be in a position to ensure that at least 10 students will be able further their education is an incredible blessing and honor.""A native of Missouri City, Texas, Thompson began his entrepreneurial journey as a college student when his older brother Branden introduced him to cryptocurrency and investing. He began studying the industry and developed a knack for teaching others how to make profitable investments. Sensing an opportunity to build a following by inspiring others to join the cryptocurrency movement, Thompson, along with his brother Branden and four fellow Morehouse students (Nathan Samuel, Reynaldo Perez, Joshua Stewart, and Ian Jackson) formed the TradeHouse Investment Group. The goal of the company is to teach financial literacy through investment strategies and to provide a platform that offers economic and social advancement to traditionally disenfranchised communities. The partners' networking savvy and charisma grew the company into a multi-million-dollar business in just 2 years. And it all started at an HBCU. ""I am a testament to how giving back can change the trajectory of one's life,"" he says. ""If it were not for my uncle's generosity, I wouldn't have been able to attend Morehouse and develop a network of like-minded individuals who would go on to become my business partners. Investing in my community will always be one of the smartest, most valuable business decisions I'll ever make.""To learn more about Bryce Thompson, please visit: www.brycethompsonofficial.com or Instagram: www.instagram.com/bthompsonofficialAbout Bryce ThompsonThompson hopes to encourage people through his story and journey that they too can make a significant impact and hold important roles no matter their age, skin color, or circumstance. He wants to inspire people to go off the beaten path and create their own success through entrepreneurship. If Thompson could say one thing to young people it would be, ""Your goals are your goals, and no-one else's. Believe in your goals and the things that you do because what makes sense to you doesn't have to make sense to anyone else.""

This increased consumption of video content has changed the face of how content is delivered. These days, video seems to be everywhere. But trends such as smartphones, social media and streaming services have all contributed to changes in how we view content, which in turn has influenced the video production industry. Not only are people watching video on their smartphones, but they are also making it themselves. Social media apps such as Snapchat, Vine and Facebook's live video option have given amateurs a simple, inexpensive method to create and share video. Brands are also taking advantage of the popularity of social media. An article on Social Media Headquarters addressed the impact on how social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have had a profound influence on the entertainment industry over the past decade. It said: ""Social media has completely changed the dynamic of what it means to be ""Internet famous."" It's easy to point to a whole group of Internet influencers who are literally ""famous for being famous."" Someone like a Kardashian is then able to parlay that influence and reach into brand partnerships, reality TV deals and lots of free swag. They can get paid thousands of dollars for simply talking about a new product or promoting a big event."" Active Companies in the markets today include Grom Social Enterprises, Inc. (OTCQB: GRMM), fuboTV Inc. (NYSE: FUBO), Discovery Communications (NASDAQ: DISCA), Roku, Inc. (NASDAQ: ROKU), iQIYI Inc.

That's a huge difference in how we think about monetization. You can literally become a YouTube millionaire by constantly pushing out short video clips that rack up hundreds of thousands of views at a time. In the pre-social media era, a top singer might release a single album per year and then tour the world to promote that new album. Now, they can use platforms like YouTube, Instagram or even Spotify to monetize all of their new creative content.""Grom Social Enterprises, Inc.

And after turning their focus to building more valuable assets around the cars everyone's pining after. Their market cap now stands at more than 5x the value of GM, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler combined. This is why Business Insider says, ""Tesla's services could be worth more than its car business.""This revenue-driving strategy is a huge part of why many are comparing Elon Musk to Apple's legendary founder, Steve Jobs. And now, one small Canadian company is following the same ""sum of all parts"" strategy aimed at achieving great results.Facedrive (FD,FDVRF) is a ridesharing company that gives customers a choice between grabbing a ride in eco-friendly electric vehicles or in standard vehicles…And they've seen incredible growth over the last year adding major assets and verticals to the company.That creative problem-solving has helped them ink important deals with government agencies, A-list celebrities, and even Big Tech juggernauts. They've already seen 569% gains over the last year. By using this same ""sum of the parts"" strategy employed by Tesla, they could soon become a household name and take their brands internationally in 2021.More and More Revenue StreamsAnyone betting against Tesla at this point hasn't been paying attention over the last year. In fact, those who bet against them in 2020 lost a total of $38 billion in all.That's because not only has Tesla been riding the electric vehicle boom that's taken over the auto industry...They've also gone beyond that to add services and recurring revenue to their model. With this, they're not just selling a car and banking on one sale every 5 to 10 years.They plan on driving massive amounts of revenue each month from their various services provided to their customers. Among them, they've been building services out for their upcoming autopilot software, car insurance division, and the long-awaited Tesla network - providing access to charging stations around the nation.They're not alone though. Apple has been following a similar path, becoming far more than just a computer company in recent years. With their release of the Apple One bundle, they now provide streaming music, TV shows, and movies, news, and arcade games. By 2025, Apple services are expected to top $50 billion in revenue, even outearning the iPhone at that point.Facedrive has been making moves of their own throughout the last year. While the ridesharing industry took a hit amidst global lockdowns, they didn't let that slow down their growth curve.They've acquired several food delivery businesses that helped them add hundreds of thousands of restaurants to their network and countless new customers. They acquired Foodora Canada, which was previously a subsidiary company of the $20-billion multinational food delivery service, Delivery Hero, operating in 40 countries and servicing more than 500,000 restaurants.Then just a few months later, they acquired Food HWY, a leading ""ethnic and student-focused"" food delivery service. But Facebook was looking to Tesla's ""sum of all parts"" strategy, which wasn't confined to just adding services in their own industry...Thinking Outside The Industry BoxOver the last several decades, major automakers have mainly been seen as one-trick ponies. They may come out with some new bells and whistles every few years, but by and large, we've all come to know Ford and GM as fairly predictable car companies.Tesla, on the other hand, has gone out of its way to not become boxed in like the others. With a bigger vision of bringing green initiatives to their customers in any way possible, they've also branched out to produce home energy products.In April 2015, they introduced a line of home batteries, called the Powerwall, that serve as energy storage systems in homes or businesses. These connect to your solar energy system at home, allowing you to store up power and use it for backup in case of emergencies.The Future of Ridesharing For years, Elon musk has been ahead of his time in the auto industry. When other major automakers were busy building just another four-door sedan, he managed to make electric vehicles a sleek status symbol that people were willing to pay top dollar for. With his goal of creating full self-driving cars in the near future, he's also planning to disrupt the booming ridesharing industry.Once Tesla owners are able to rent out their fully self-driving cars in the future, some people floated estimates you could make up to $30,000 per year in a robotaxi network when you're not using your Tesla. However, Musk is also become infamous for overselling the self-driving dream with an overly ambitious timeline.For example, he once said he expected to have over a million self-driving cars on the road by the end of 2020. Clearly, we've fallen well short of that goal, although major progress has been made in that area.Apple had major news of their own recently, with leaks of an Apple car hitting headlines across the Internet. Like with Tesla though, we are likely still a long ways off from seeing anything actually come to market.With many predicting an Apple car won't be unveiled until 2024, realistically you may not be able to purchase one until sometime between 2025 and 2027. There is one company that's already challenging the ridesharing industry though. Because amidst the multi-trillion dollar ESG boom, Facedrive (FD,FDVRF) has been providing a green alternative to Uber for years. And unlike Uber, which has been accused of price-gouging and taking over 50% of the cut for themselves at times...Facedrive lets their drivers keep up to 90% of the fare and 100% of their tips. Plus, they recently acquired the electric vehicle service company, Steer, from the largest clean energy producer in the United States. Steer's subscription model for EV cars could help put an end to the traditional car ownership model as we know it. And that fits right in line with Facedrive's mission to provide eco-friendly rides wherever their customers need them.Tesla dominated the markets in 2020 with their ""sum of all parts"" strategy, and Facedrive is working to copy the strategy that got them there.Not to be outdone, however, traditional automakers are racing alongside of Big Tech to get ahead of this futuristic trend, as well. From GM and Ford to tech giants like Microsoft, Google and Intel, some of the most exciting breakthroughs in this industry are already coming to fruition.Leading the charge is Waymo, a subsidy of tech giant Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Waymo may just be the de facto leader in the emerging autonomous vehicle industry. It's already had cars driving themselves across the United States for several years. In fact, in Arizona alone, Alphabet's self-driving cars have logged over 6.1 million miles. To put that in perspective, that means that Alphabet's autonomous cars have driven the distance between New York City and San Francisco over 2100 times. Or, as the company explains, ""over 500 years of driving for the average licensed US driver."" While these tests are extremely promising for Alphabet's Waymo, there are still some hurdles to overcome. First and foremost, these lengthy trials took place in Phoenix, a city not exactly known for extreme weather. While Alphabet's Waymo gets a lot of credit for these massive accomplishments, a widely loved and wildly popular chipmaker is at its core. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Waymo teamed up way back in 2017, and have worked together to fine tune their technology together ever since. Through their mutual knowledge of hardware and software, the tech giants have made leaps and bounds towards building the car of the future. In addition to its efforts with Waymo, Intel has also been on the forefront of developing its own artificial intelligence and vision hardware. Back in 2017, it acquired MobileEye, a supplier of camera-based chips and software to the global mobile industry. Another giant, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is also getting into the game. Microsoft's Azure cloud-based infrastructure and edge computing is going to be pivotal in this new industry. Not only will it allow automakers to analyze data and optimize their products, it will give them the opportunity to conduct advanced tests and simulations to fine-tune their software in risk-free environments. It's even partnering with leaders in the auto industry such as Renault and Audi.Mark Everest, Information Systems Development Manager, Renault Sport Formula One Team noted, ""There are so many factors that are constantly changing and can affect race strategy: track temperature, tire performance, what the other drivers are doing. Simulation helps us quickly understand how to configure the car for a particular track.""Traditional automakers aren't going to be left behind, either. Both Ford and GM are betting big on this emerging new industry.In October, auto industry legend, General Motors (NYSE:GM), announced that it's majority-owned subsidiary, Cruise, has just received approval from the California DMV to test its autonomous vehicles without a driver. And while they're not the first to receive such an approval, it's still huge news for GM.Cruise CEO Dan Ammann wrote in a Medium post, ""Before the end of the year, we'll be sending cars out onto the streets of SF — without gasoline and without anyone at the wheel. Because safely removing the driver is the true benchmark of a self-driving car, and because burning fossil fuels is no way to build the future of transportation."" Ford (NYSE:F) for its part, has recently revealed plans to launch its self-driving business in 2022. The new vehicles, in partnership with Argo AI, a Philadelphia-based autonomous vehicle startup, will include major upgrades from advanced Lidar technology and high resolution cameras. Ford plans to test these vehicles in Austin, Texas; Detroit; Miami; Palo Alto, California; Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C. as early as this month. John Davis, chief engineer of Ford's autonomous vehicle subsidiary explained, ""We're confident that we're on the path to launching a safe, reliable and affordable service. And, we look forward to telling you more about how this service will ultimately help make people's lives better."" By. Paula White**IMPORTANT!

A good privacy-protecting move is to turn off your Location Services on your phone for all social media apps and your camera. If you have an iPhone, you can find this in Settings, Privacy, then Location Services. On Android, go to Settings, then Location to turn off Location Sharing, Location HistoryMore news about: Avast","Avast","PRAGUE, Jan. 28, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Ahead of International Data Protection Day on Thursday 28 January, Avast, a global leader in digital security and privacy products, is calling on all online users to take back their privacy across their digital lifestyle.The purpose of Data Protection Day is to raise awareness and promote privacy and data protection best practices.""It's important to not be apathetic when it comes to online privacy and to regularly look at how you can stay in control over your privacy and the personal data you share online, including on social media and apps that many of us use every day,"" said Shane McNamee, Chief Privacy Officer at Avast.""Next week on February 4, it will be 16 years since Facebook launched and while it wasn't the first social network, it has changed how willingly we are to share personal data about ourselves online. Platforms like Facebook and Google have developed complex advertising networks which rely on personal data for targeted advertising, which can seem ever-present at times. However, there are ways you can take back some control and limit the access that websites, social media platforms, and apps have to your personal data. You have more control than you think when it comes to deciding who can see your data and what they are allowed to do with it.""Here are six simple steps that you can take in order to get some of your privacy back from social media and apps.1. Manage advertisingYou can restrict what data advertisers use to target you on different social media platforms. Have a good look through your privacy and advertising settings and make sure you remove interests that the platform can use to target you, which you can do, for example, on Facebook and Twitter. Where possible, toggle off or remove any personal data that can also be used for ad targeting. You can also limit tracking and ad targeting by these platforms based on your browsing off social media, such as by turning off 'Off-Twitter Activity' on Twitter and removing 'Ads Shown off of Facebook' on Facebook.2. Turn off location trackingLocation tracking and history, even location metadata in your photos, can allow social media platforms and apps to track and catalogue your precise locations and then serve you personalised ads. A good privacy-protecting move is to turn off your Location Services on your phone for all social media apps and your camera. If you have an iPhone, you can find this in Settings, Privacy, then Location Services. On Android, go to Settings, then Location to turn off Location Sharing, Location History and adjust location access for apps.3. Don't log inOn certain social media platforms, like Twitter and TikTok, you don't need to log in to view content. By choosing not to log in, it takes away a really big amount of data that they could potentially collect, such as your user journey through the network, including content you search and engage with, and ads you click.4. Revoke app and game permissionsIf you're like most people, you've probably signed into other apps and websites with your Facebook or Google login details. While this is super convenient, it also gives those sites access to your data and gives the platform you use to log in more information about you. Through your Facebook settings you can revoke permissions or you can choose what data the apps and games you still use have access to. Similarly, you can manage third-party access to your Google account through your security settings.5. Don't click on adsMany social media platforms and apps track not only which ads you click on but also how long you spend looking at them or swiping through them. If you don't want social media platforms or apps to have information about your interests, then get in the habit of really ignoring ads all together and don't use the Shop feature you can find in Instagram and on Google, for example. If you see something that you like, you can search for it via your browser whilst using a VPN, like Avast SecureLine VPN, which makes it harder for third-parties to track your online activities.6. Create a burner email addressIf you're going to truly take back some of your privacy, you can start from square one by creating a burner email address. A burner email — which is an email address that you only use for specific things and that isn't linked to you elsewhere — makes it much more difficult for companies to track you. You can easily create one for free on Gmail, but just be sure not to link it to your main account. Even better, use a different email service than the one you usually use, so you don't accidentally link them up.For more tips around how to protect your online privacy, check out Avast's Privacy Refresh blogs for Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Twitter.

(PRNewsfoto/Tapinator, Inc.)Lucky Lotto was designed to be a highly authentic scratch-off lottery game that Tapinator has reimagined in the context of a mobile, interactive, environmentally conscious and free-to-play gaming experience. The current game allows players to level up, unlock new tickets and collect mega wins. Players can enjoy a large variety of beautiful scratch games including: 2000X the Money, Wild Cash, Glistening Gems, Instant Millionaire, Vault of Gold, USA Lotsa Cash and many more.The Lucky Lotto mobile game features: 32 unique scratch-offs with bonus minigames and huge multipliers Authentic scratching effects - just like the real thing Huge wins with up to 34 wins per ticket Special numbers that reveal instant bonuses including 5X, 10X, 50X, WILD and more Play for FREE with Bonus Coins every 2 Hours Play anytime, anywhere from the convenience of your iPhone or iPadLucky Lotto Mega Scratchers can be downloaded exclusively on iOS by using the following link:Lucky Lotto Download LinkFollowing its initial global launch on iOS in late December, Lucky Lotto has achieved the following preliminary metrics: More than 10,000 player downloads Excellent rating of 4.6 (out of 5.0) stars, based on over 600 player reviews More than 1.2 million lottery tickets scratched Reached Top 125 Casino Games in the USTapinator's CEO, Ilya Nikolayev, commented on the recent release, ""We achieved a successful initial global pilot launch with Lucky Lotto on iOS and, based on the warm player reception, we plan to invest significantly to further enrich the game with additional features and functionality. Our intention is to make Lucky Lotto a true social casino category leader across all major mobile platforms. The social casino genre has shown to support top grossing games with extremely long lifespans and, that within this genre, the lottery category is still nascent. We look forward to making significant game enhancements that we expect will continue to improve player engagement and ultimately monetization, thereby allowing us to scale up our user acquisition budget later this year. We are also planning to release versions of the game for Google Play and Amazon Kindle later this year. While I would caution that it is still extremely early in the game's lifecycle, based on our market analysis, we believe Lucky Lotto has the potential to join Video Poker Classic as a second major pillar within our social casino portfolio and, ultimately, becoming a meaningful contributor to the Company's overall financial results. I look forward to providing future updates as we execute against the product's broad roadmap.""Tapinator's President, Andrew Merkatz, commented on the addressable market for Lucky Lotto. ""According to Lottery Now Inc, lottery is a $350B global market. Despite being larger than music, movies, video games and professional sports combined, the lottery industry has yet to meaningfully embrace mobile distribution. Inspecting more deeply, according to La Fleur Magazine, total FY19 U.S. instant ticket sales jumped 4% to $50.1 billion, up $2.1 billion over the previous year. Instant ticket sales represented 62% of the U.S. lotteries' total traditional sales in FY19. We believe that lottery in general, and particularly the market for instant tickets, e.g. scratch-offs, represents a massive opportunity that is ripe for digital disruption. We believe Tapinator is well positioned to leverage its expertise in free-to-play social casino gaming to pioneer and capture share within the emerging and exciting market for mobile scratch-off games.""Lucky Lotto is the first of three planned major releases for Tapinator's Category-Leading Games business that we plan to announce in 2021.

(""Silvus"") today announced the company is going under contract for Phase Three of the DARPA Scalable Wideband Autonomous RF Mapping MANET (SWARMM) program to deliver a matured radio frequency (RF) spectrum scanning technology. The SWARMM program is based on Silvus' Filtering by Aliasing Spectrum Sensing Technology (FASST). The FASST sensor is designed to deliver extremely fast spectrum scanning speed – 6 to 60 THz/sec – in a form factor the size of an iPhone.Silvus' FASST has great potential due to its ability to offer high performance in a small form factor, utilizing periodic spreading sequences to quickly and efficiently isolate different portions of the spectrum. This rapid capture of samples across a broad frequency range enables significant improvement in the probability of intercept of arbitrary RF activity using small sensor packages. The SWARMM program utilizes this new FASST capability to enable wide area source detection. ""We have seen tremendous development and interest in FASST over the last couple of years,"" said Dr. Mansour Rachid, Silvus Director of Systems Engineering. ""As we enter into Phase Three of SWARMM, we intend to deliver high-speed, low-cost sensors that offer an alternative approach to RF sensing and rapid detection and reporting.""DARPA plans to employ FASST with other technologies to form a robust system-of-systems concept that enables improved RF situational awareness. Silvus is scheduled to demonstrate the FASST system's matured operation at a field test in March 2021.About Silvus Technologies, Inc.Privately held and headquartered in Los Angeles, Silvus Technologies develops advanced MIMO technologies that are reshaping broadband wireless connectivity for mission critical applications.

Apple has the success of its diversification strategy to thank for an impressive 87% brand value increase to US$263.4 billion and its position at the top of the Brand Finance US 500 2021 ranking and Brand Finance Global 500 2021 ranking.Laurence Newell, Managing Director, Brand Finance Americas, commented:""Steve Jobs' legacy continues to flow through Apple, with innovation built into the brand's DNA. As Apple reclaims the title of the world's most valuable brand from Amazon five years since it last held the top spot, we are witnessing it Think Different once again. From Mac to iPod, to iPhone, to iPad, to Apple Watch, to subscription services, to infinity and beyond."" Tesla races up rankingThe importance of technological innovation as a driving force behind brand value is best exemplified by Tesla (up 158% to US$32 billion), the fastest-growing brand in the Brand Finance US 500 2021 and Brand Finance Global 500 2021 ranking. Emerging unscathed from the various controversies surrounding CEO, Elon Musk, Tesla's market capitalization has grown by an eyewatering US$500 billion over the last year, making it worth as much as the next nine largest automobile manufacturers in the world combined. AMD leapfrogs aheadAMD (up 89% to US$2.7 billion) is the fastest growing tech brand, the second-fastest growing brand in the US overall and the biggest mover in the ranking this year, jumping up 186 spots from 473rd to 287th. Laurence Newell, Managing Director, Brand Finance Americas, commented:""As artificial intelligence, data centers, 5G technology, IoT, and autonomous vehicles are rapidly growing, semiconductor brands are perfectly positioned to match this growth as demand requires a new era of sensors, memory and chips.""The impressive growth of the AMD brand can be attributed to the highly anticipated upcoming launch of its Ryzen 5000 Mobile series and many other impressive innovations.Nvidia (up 73% to US$8.1 billion) is the fifth-fastest growing brand in the Brand Finance US 500 2021 ranking, an upward trajectory it plans on continuing through its US$40 billion deal to acquire British chip designer Arm. From product setbacks and sales delays, to COVID-19 and Apple making its own computer chips, Intel has negotiated a turbulent year. Despite this, the California-based tech multinational has managed to increase its brand value by 16% to US$31.8 billion, placing 19th overall in the US. In a move to remain relevant in an increasingly competitive market, Intel has also undergone a rebranding to better reflect its future goals.COVID docks cruisesThe ongoing global pandemic has strongly impacted the travel and tourism industries, with cruises being at the helm. Cruises disappear from the Brand Finance US 500 2021 ranking for the first time ever, with Royal Caribbean International (down 90% to US$494 million) dropping 631 spots from 169th to 800th, and Norwegian Cruise Line (down 98% to US$49 million) dropping 1,159 spots to 1,439th overall.Long haul problems for aviation A clear impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, US-based airlines have decreased in brand value across the board, with Boeing (down 40% to US$13.6 billion) among the top ten fastest falling brands for 2021. Following suit, American Airlines (down 40% to US$5.3 billion), United Airlines (down 39% to US$5 billion) and Delta (down 38% to US$5.8 billion) each experienced significant losses in brand value. Boeing's woes continue after hitting headlines at the beginning of this year when its 737-500 passenger plane crashed in Indonesia, its reputation taking yet another battering.Coca-Cola claims podium spotIn addition to measuring overall brand value, Brand Finance also evaluates the relative strength of brands, based on factors such as marketing investment, customer familiarity, staff satisfaction, and corporate reputation. According to these criteria, Coca-Cola (down 13% to US$33.2 billion) has overtaken Disney (down 9% to US$51.2 billion) as the US' strongest brand, and 4th globally, with a Brand Strength Index (BSI) score of 91.7 out of 100. The soft drinks giant was not immune from the impact of COVID-19, however, with the multinational forced to restructure, which has seen over 2000 jobs cut and the brand lose over a tenth of its value this year.Coca-Cola's biggest soft-drink rival, Pepsi (down 3% to 18.4 billion), is also one of this year's strongest performing brands, ranking ninth overall in the US with a BSI score of 88.4 out of 100 and a AAA rating.Meet the world's top Brand GuardiansThis year's top CEO in the Brand Finance Brand Guardianship Index is Mastercard's Ajay Banga. Mr Banga announced his transition from CEO to executive chairman in 2020, rounding off a successful and decorated 10 years as CEO. Since taking the helm of Mastercard, Mr Banga has embraced technological innovation, ensuring the brand remained relevant despite a period of rapid change in financial services. Mr Banga also champions the idea of financial inclusion, and has leveraged his influence to build strategic partnerships with financial institutions worldwide to help fight poverty.View the full Brand Finance US 500 2021 report hereView the full Brand Finance Global 500 2021 report hereNote to EditorsBrand Finance is the world's leading brand valuation consultancy with its US base in Dallas, Texas.

""While our long-time collaborator Wacom joins the Works With ChromebookMore news about: Wacom","Wacom","TOKYO and PORTLAND, Ore., Jan. 26, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Wacom continues to expand its efforts to support the education sector with the necessary solutions and services to create teacher and student-friendly technology for the digital classroom. As a next important step, Wacom announced today that its One by Wacom pen tablet is the first Wacom device to be fully compatible with Chromebooks and holds the Works With Chromebook certification. To help teachers and students to get the most from using a Wacom pen in education, Wacom is building a library of content consolidating all information on Wacom for Education with Chromebook and launched a Teachers for Teachers support network. And to meet the wide-ranging requirements of the education sector, school administrators and institutional buyers now have access to all Wacom products through one point of contact – from stand-alone tools for teachers and students to integrated solutions for schools and institutions. One by Wacom pen tablet holds the Works With Chromebook certification. Great news for the education sector, especially K-12.""Digitalization has great benefits for the education sector. But it has proven to be challenging,"" says Faik Karaoglu, Executive Vice President of Wacom's Branded Business. ""As a pioneer of digital pen technology, Wacom is committed to provide teachers, students and administrators with reliable, sustainable and easy to use solutions. The new compatibility with Wacom pen tablets and displays will make creating, working and teaching digitally as natural and intuitive as possible and offer users more possibilities to work with their Chromebook.""Wacom and Chromebook take digital learning to the next level The digital pen is a powerful tool in education. It allows teachers and students to incorporate natural handwriting for note-taking and annotation and lets them solve math problems, draw diagrams and explain themselves visually as intuitively online as they would in class on the blackboard. Especially STEAM subjects (science, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics) benefit a great deal from the use of a digital pen. Combining a One by Wacom pen tablet with the advantages of Chromebook offers students and teachers a valuable upgrade to their existing set up and provides schools with a worry-free solution – be it on premise, in hybrid scenarios or for teaching and learning from home. Together they work with a wealth of online educational tools, so that teachers and students can easily connect, interact and collaborate from different locations and across multiple devices in real time. Chromebooks give students, teachers and administrators a simple yet powerful solution for fast, intuitive, and easy-to-manage computing at a low total cost of ownership. And even though recent Chromebooks are often enabled with pens that work on their build-in screen, users now have an option to attach a simple accessory in case they want to upgrade or complement their Chromebooks with dedicated pen input on a separate surface other than the main screen. Wacom is therefore working with Google to expand compatibility to include additional Wacom devices and bring more pen tablets and displays to a growing group of Chromebook users. One for easy beginnings The One by Wacom pen tablet makes going digital easy as it connects seamlessly with any Chromebook featuring USB-A and the latest Chrome OS version. It is ready to use out-of-the-box and requires no drivers and no software. The responsive, ergonomic, pressure-sensitive pen gives users a natural way to write, sketch, draw or edit content on the Wacom pen tablet connected to the Chromebook. The pen is battery free and works without charging exclusively on the surface of this Wacom device. It is lightweight, perfectly balanced and comfortable to use for hours. The experience immediately feels familiar – like pen on paper or marker on a whiteboard. One by Wacom and Chromebook also offers a great start to explore digital creativity with a growing number of drawing, painting and photo editing applications created especially for Chrome OS. One by Wacom is fully supported by Celsys' recently launched CLIP STUDIO PAINT drawing software for Chrome OS.""Clip Studio Paint for Chromebook includes all features and offers the same capabilities as the Android, Galaxy, Windows, macOS, iPad and iPhone versions"" says Celsys President Kei Narushima. ""While our long-time collaborator Wacom joins the Works With Chromebook certification program, Celsys is working towards Chromebook support for Wacom devices to provide a smooth creative experience for all digital creators. With the foray into the Chromebook space, the alliance between Clip Studio Paint and Wacom is further enhanced.""One by Wacom is now compatible with Chromebook, Windows and Mac OS devices. It uses a proprietary Wacom technology exclusively for the dedicated tablet surface and works independently from, and will not interfere with, on-screen pens based on the Universal Stylus Initiative (USI)* pen standard that either comes with the Chromebooks or can be purchased as accessories. One by Wacom is available at the Wacom eStore and select resellers with a recommended retail price of $59.95 (USD). Support and solutions from teachers for teachersWacom is committed to give teachers, tutors and students the tools and solutions they need for engaging online classes. Its vast network of local partners means customers can refer to local support in many languages. In addition, Wacom will launch its new Teachers for Teachers initiative, a network to connect teachers and communities for support and exchange experiences. To make the transition to online teaching as smooth as possible, Wacom collected a wealth of information and helpful tips on its dedicated Wacom for e-learning pages and partnered with five leading educational software applications. Collaboard, Explain Everything, Kami, Limnu and Pear Deck offer powerful interactive whiteboarding, video tutoring and online collaboration tools as learning and teaching shifts to the digital classroom.

Abbott is offering two distinct digital solutions to support each of these functions.Abbott's NAVICA mobile app for iPhone and Android devices allows people who test negative to display a temporary digital health certificate that is renewed each time a person is testedMore news about: Abbott","Abbott","ABBOTT PARK, Ill., Jan. 26, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Abbott (NYSE: ABT) announced today it has received CE Mark for two new uses of its Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus: asymptomatic testing and self-swabbing.Panbio COVID-19 Ag's label has been updated with clinical data on asymptomatic individuals, which enables mass testing (mass screening1) of people who do not currently present symptoms of the disease. According to a recent study published in JAMA,2 at least 50% of COVID-19 infections are estimated to have originated from exposure to asymptomatic individuals.The other update to the label allows self-collection of nasal specimens under the supervision of a healthcare worker. Self-swabbing with a patient-friendly nasal swab improves patient comfort and reduces the risk of accidental exposure to the virus for healthcare workers as they can maintain distance during the testing procedure.""Rapid testing continues to be one of our most important tools for fighting this pandemic, and the ability to perform mass screening allows us to expand testing and reach more people in more places,"" said Robert B. Ford, president and chief executive officer, Abbott. ""Now that Abbott's Panbio rapid antigen test has an asymptomatic indication, it becomes an even more valuable tool for enabling a safer return to work, school, travel and other activities of daily life.""Since last August to date, Abbott has shipped 200 million Panbio rapid antigen tests to 120 countries across Europe, the Americas, Asia and Africa. Healthcare professionals globally have seen the clinical utility of the test in detecting COVID-19 infections. In coordination with the Global Fund, the World Health Organization and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Abbott continues to make Panbio rapid antigen tests available to low- and middle-income countries.Panbio COVID-19 Ag is not available in the U.S., where Abbott manufactures and sells the BinaxNOW™ COVID-19 Ag Card, which has received emergency use authorization (EUA) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Abbott is in the process of pursuing FDA EUA of an asymptomatic indication for BinaxNOW.Both Panbio and BinaxNOW rapid antigen tests use similar biologics and are highly portable, reliable and affordable.Widespread, frequent and fast testing facilitates return to workThe large number of COVID-19 cases and fear of disease spread has resulted in a global economic recession, increased workplace absenteeism and the inability of employers to bring their employees back to the office. As a result, employers and governments around the world are looking for ways to ensure business continuity and restart their economies. Frequent and fast screening of employees using rapid antigen tests such as Panbio COVID-19 Ag – along with preventative measures such as mask-wearing, social distancing, handwashing, disinfecting facilities and any other actions required by government – can support a safer return to work by quickly identifying and isolating infected and contagious individuals. Employees who test negative can be admitted to facilities and resume their work.""Since October 2020, Abbott has used rapid antigen tests in a phased rollout of employee testing across multiple sites globally,"" said Mary Moreland, executive vice president, Human Resources, Abbott. ""Our experience proves that testing helps our employees feel safer and more comfortable coming into the office during this time, so they can more effectively collaborate with each other and perform their duties.""Expanded rapid antigen testing plays critical role in restoring freedom of mobilityBeyond workplace screening, the ability to conduct mass screenings at ports of entry using the Panbio rapid antigen test will facilitate the resumption of global travel. A number of governments now mandate proof of a negative COVID-19 viral test before entering the country.3,4 Additionally, various airlines and cruise ship companies require that passengers present negative test results before boarding. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the Airports Council International (ACI) have publicly called for a systematic approach to testing that is fast, accurate, affordable, easy-to-use, scalable and supported by public health authorities. Mass screening can help restore freedom of mobility across borders and will allow people to travel safely and with confidence.""Being able to effectively screen asymptomatic people – along with other hygienic measures already in place – is the best way to ensure the safety of our passengers and all air transport workers,"" said Olivier Jankovec, director general, Airports Council International Europe. ""Over 100 airports across Europe are already providing COVID-19 testing facilities in close cooperation with their health authorities. Rapid screening using high-quality and affordable antigen tests is a crucial part of resuscitating global travel until the vast majority of the world's travelers and crews are vaccinated.""Digital solutions facilitate return to daily life and understanding epidemiological trendsDigital health technologies play an important role in pandemic response.5 Integrated into testing strategies, digital technologies can support mass screening of people for safe entry into facilities and disease surveillance management to understand epidemiological trends. Abbott is offering two distinct digital solutions to support each of these functions.Abbott's NAVICA mobile app for iPhone and Android devices allows people who test negative to display a temporary digital health certificate that is renewed each time a person is tested by a healthcare worker together with the date of the test result. Organizations using the NAVICA verifier app can scan and verify the information on a mobile device to manage safe entry into workplaces, airplanes and cruise ships, schools and universities, and other places where people come together in large numbers. NAVICA for use with Panbio Ag is soon to be available at no charge to customers outside the U.S.In support of public health strategies, Abbott is offering Sympheos™, a web-based data collection and visualization tool, for use with Panbio Ag. Sympheos allows healthcare workers to log real-time test results on a smart phone, aggregate the collected data, and display it in a dashboard with heat maps, disease surveillance and testing trends. Sympheos data visualization may help health authorities better understand the epidemiological status of their epidemic and mobilize their COVID-19 response more effectively. Sympheos, which is available now to customers outside the U.S., can also be used to track in parallel other diseases such as malaria and HIV where there are high rates of co-infection.Since the pandemic began, Abbott has developed the most advanced and comprehensive portfolio of COVID-19 tests across its testing platforms — from high-throughput molecular tests on its m2000™ RealTime and Alinity™ m lab-based systems; to serology tests on its Alinity™ i and ARCHITECT® i1000SR and i2000SR instruments; to rapid molecular tests on the ID NOW™ instrument; to rapid antigen test options on BinaxNOW™ (available in the U.S. only) and the Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device (available in countries outside the U.S.). About Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device is a lateral flow assay for rapid, qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus. A nasal or nasopharyngeal swab is used for collection of specimens from individuals. Test results are delivered in as early as 15 minutes with no instrumentation.Negative results must be combined with clinical observations, patient history and epidemiological information. Negative results do not preclude COVID-19 infection and cannot be used as the sole basis for treatment or other management decisions. Clinical performance of Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device was determined by testing 483 asymptomatic people for SARS-CoV-2 antigen and comparing results against a PCR reference method.Positive results (n=50) were stratified by cycle threshold (Ct) counts in order to understand the correlation between product performance and the amount of virus present in the clinical sample. A lower Ct value corresponds to a higher concentration of the virus. Specificity of the test across 433 negative samples was 100.0%, which means no false positives were identified. Results for sensitivity were:93.8% in 32 samples with Ct values less than or equal to 30 80.0% in 40 samples with Ct values less than or equal to 33 66.0% across all 50 positive samples (at all Ct counts)There is a growing body of scientific literature6 and experience focused on the correlation between infectiousness, Ct counts and viral load. Specifically, scientific evidence suggests that at Ct counts in the 30s, the SARS-CoV-2 virus can't be replicated, meaning people are no longer infectious. This underscores the importance of frequent antigen testing to catch people with lower Ct counts while they are most contagious and need to self-quarantine. Panbio COVID-19 Ag is CE-Marked for use with a nasal swab on asymptomatic and symptomatic people. Abbott has submitted documentation to the World Health Organization for Emergency Use Listing for the two new claims for asymptomatic testing and self-swabbing. Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test device is available in countries outside of the U.S. and subject to local regulatory and commercialization requirements.About AbbottAbbott is a global healthcare leader that helps people live more fully at all stages of life.

(MMNA) today announced pricing of the redesigned, stylish and sporty 2022 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross. The new Eclipse Cross is the latest entry in the brand's intensive product initiative to launch four updated or all-new vehicles to create for dealer partners and customers one of the freshest showrooms in the industry.Mitsubishi Motors North America, Inc. announces pricing of the redesigned, stylish and sporty 2022 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross.Mitsubishi Motors North America, Inc. announces pricing of the redesigned, stylish and sporty 2022 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross.Offering a full suite of upgrades inside and out and powered by a proven turbocharged 1.5-liter direct-injection engine, the 2022 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross starts at just $23,395.1 Mitsubishi's motorsport-derived Super All-Wheel Control (S-AWC)2 all-wheel drive system can be added to any trim level for $1,600.Major Exterior RedesignAt the front of the vehicle, a new bumper and the latest, most striking version of the brand's Dynamic Shield grille design present a sportier and more futuristic appearance. A newly styled bisected lighting design features thin, high-mounted LED daytime running lights (DRLs) at the leading edge of the hood with integrated turn signal lamps just below. Presenting a bold and broad welcome that previews the new face of future Mitsubishi Motors vehicles, stacked-and-recessed assemblies combine headlamp and fog lamp in a low-mounted position for optimal visibility. The sophisticated design has been carried through to the rear of the vehicle, with a completely restyled rear hatch and window. The single-piece rear window and revised hatch design, combined with an increase in overall vehicle length, add both styling and cargo space benefits, with the update providing one additional cubic foot of storage with the tonneau cover installed. Eclipse Cross now offers maximum total storage capacity of 50.1 cubic feet with the second row folded, and 23.4 cubic feet with the second row upright. The sharply sculpted hexagonal liftgate design is a nod to famous Mitsubishi vehicles of the past, and integrates the vehicle's iconic three-dimensional taillights to create a wide and stable presence.The extensive redesign of the 2022 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross results in a longer, sleeker and more luxurious compact SUV. The vehicle has gained more than five inches in overall length, now measuring 178.9 inches long, 71.1 inches wide and 66.3 inches high in 2WD, and 66.5 inches high in S-AWC. The wheelbase remains unchanged at 105.1 inches. Designers increased the vehicle's front and rear overhangs for both improved functionality (cargo capacity) and to optimize proportions for an appealing, sporty aesthetic.New Interior Design Inside the updated Eclipse Cross, the interior now offers a light gray leather seat option with color-contrasting black accents for the first time ever. This new interior color choice is only available on the SEL trim. The new interior color option is complemented by color-coordinated door trim and seats, leading to a high-quality and refined interior aesthetic. Also new is an optional power passenger seat, available on SEL models.Driver and front passenger heated seats are standard on LE, SE and SEL trims. A heated steering wheel is standard on the SEL trim, while the SEL with Touring package adds heated rear seats. The rear seats feature a standard reclining function, with nine distinct recline positions.Redesigned Infotainment and New Embedded NavigationHighlighting the upgraded interior is a new eight-inch Smartphone-link Display Audio (SDA) system, available on LE, SE and SEL trims, offering drivers more ways to stay safely connected while on the road. The touchscreen has been moved two inches closer to the driver and features volume and tuning knobs for easier use. The previous center console touchpad has been removed. Vehicles equipped with the new eight-inch SDA system feature standard Apple CarPlay®3 and Android Auto™4 integration.ES trims receive a standard seven-inch Display Audio touchscreen infotainment system.An onboard navigation system with industry-first embedded what3words integration is now standard on Eclipse Cross SE and SEL, the first time Eclipse Cross has been fitted with embedded navigation. As a global addressing system, what3words divides the world into a grid of three-meter-by-three-meter squares, each of which is assigned a unique what3words address. The system allows pinpoint navigation, even in remote, unpopulated areas, offering greater accuracy and specificity than street address-based systems.The optional navigation system also includes TomTom5 live traffic information and mapping. The 2022 Eclipse Cross is the first production vehicle to be offered with what3words embedded directly into its navigation system.Revised Suspension & Handling The changes to 2022 Eclipse Cross go beyond the sheet metal. Increases to the front and rear overhangs as part of the styling update could easily present a tuning challenge, with increased polar momentum requiring detailed changes. As such, engineers worked to ensure the vehicle retained its comfortable and confident driving feel. The suspension has been thoroughly refined, with retuned shocks and springs, including the addition of larger rear shock shafts for better ride control. Engineers also addressed both bounce and rebound control to provide a smooth yet sporty ride, regardless of road surface. Additional changes include the rear suspension cross member now being connected by a double vibration insulator for a more rigid connection, offering a more planted feel than the previous bushing setup. Expanded Availability of Safety Features Across the LineupContinuing Mitsubishi's commitment to safety and value, every 2022 Eclipse Cross receives standard advanced driver assistance systems, including standard Forward Collision Mitigation (FCM) with Pedestrian Detection6 and Lane Departure Warning (LDW)7 on all trims.Those seeking the latest safety technology will also appreciate that Automatic High Beam (AHB) assist headlamps and rain-sensing wipers are standard on LE, SE and SEL trim levels. SE and above trims continue to offer other key safety features as standard equipment, including Blind Spot Warning (BSW) with Lane Change Assist (LCA)8 and Rear Cross Traffic Alert (RCTA).9Detailed Pricing and WarrantyEvery 2022 Eclipse Cross boasts one of the industry's leading warranties10: a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain limited warranty; 5-year/60,000-mile new vehicle limited warranty; 7-year/100,000-mile anti-corrosion/perforation limited warranty; and 5-year/unlimited mileage roadside assistance program.Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Prices (MSRP)1 for the 2022 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross in 2WD trim follow below.

As one of the most widely used passive components, MLCC commands approximately 40% of the capacitor market. MLCC finds broad application in fields like communication, consumer electronics, automobile and military, where the robust demand conduces to the expanding MLCC market.A staggering 64% or so of MLCCs are consumed by consumer electronics, especially smartphones which occupy 39% of total consumption. In iPhone's case, smartphones with higher configuration use more MLCCs, e.g., an iPhone X needs as many as 1,100 MLCCs compared with an iPhone 5S using 400 pieces. Besides, the portable and intelligent wearables such as TWS headphones and smart watches have drawn much attention from the market over recent years, producing significant demand for MLCCs.As commercial use of 5G is at a gallop, 5G-enabled smartphones will pack more MLCCs than 4G ones. Examples include a Sub-6Ghz 5G smartphone that uses 10%-15% more MLCCs and an mmWave 5G phone adding 20%-30%. Meanwhile, 5G smartphones' higher power consumption further drives up demand for high-end, micro/ultra-micro (0201, 01005, etc.) MLCCs with large capacity and low power consumption.During the faster construction of 5G in 2020, a larger number of 5G base stations to be built and more MLCCs per such a station compared with 4G ones are two factors behind the rising demand for MLCCs. By 2023, global communication base stations' demand for MLCCs will be 2.1-fold of that in 2019, estimated by Taiyo Yuden. In the meantime, internet of things (IoT) that requires far more stable connectivity will be a beneficiary of low-latency 5G network. A study of VENKEL shows that a terminal needs over 75 MLCCs on average, from which it can be foreseen that more and more connected IOT devices will, beyond doubt, spur the MLCC market to grow.The development of new energy vehicle and ADAS drives MLCC into a new blue ocean. A common car needs around 3,000 or 4,000 MLCCs while a hybrid/plug-in hybrid vehicle bears around 12,000 pieces and a battery electric vehicle carries virtually 18,000 pieces.Among vehicle electronic systems, ADAS which applies more MLCCs could collect, detect, recognize and track changed data inside and outside of the vehicle in the shortest time via sensors on the vehicle and helps the driver beware of potential dangers to operate correctly and safely by combining navigation map data to calculate and analyze. Wider coverage of 5G network will be another solution to latency problem. As more and more vehicles carry ADAS that tends to be more intelligent, the demand for MLCCs will multiply.New energy vehicle with a larger number of control modules like ECU need more passive components to support electronic systems, with a new energy vehicle in want of at least 10,000 MLCCs. With the roll-out of timetables for elimination of ICE vehicles across the world in recent years, new energy vehicles have boasted higher penetration, coupled with more use of MLCCs by a single vehicle, together stimulating the demand for automotive MLCCs.Of a wide range of automotive MLCC models, those with size ranging from 0402 to 2220 are in use while 0603, 0805 and 1206 get most utilized. Despite unconcern about size of MLCCs, automotive market has a high demanding on them in safety parameters (reliability, service life and failure rate) as well as working temperature, humidity, climate and vibration resistance. Automotive market poses a high entry barrier to MLCC which must be subject to a set of automotive standards (AEC-Q200) and pass quality certification.It is in the MLCC market that leading players include Murata, Samsung Electro-Mechanics, Yageo, Walsin Technology, Taiyo Yuden, TDK, Kyocera and Chinese Mainland companies like Fenghua Advanced Technology and Chaozhou Three-circle. Since 2016, few MLCC vendors like Murata and TDK have shifted to focus on automotive MLCC, a promising and lucrative high-tech market. This move disrupts the global passive components supply chain and makes low- and mid-end customers turn to companies like Yageo, Fenghua Advanced Technology and Chaozhou Three-circle.Some vendors have pivoted to the automotive MLCC market.Murata is the MLCC vendor with the highest market share in the world (approximately 56% of the automotive MLCC market), boasting annual capacity up to 1,100 billion MLCCs or so. In recent years, the company has slashed the capacity of low-end MLCCs while ramping up production of automotive and other high-end products. Murata quickens the R&D and mass production of MLCCs for high-end consumer electronics whilst expediting to launch automotive products. In 2019, Murata began to spawn 008004, which will be used in 5G flagship phones of Apple and Huawei. In April 2020, Murata started mass-production of two new multilayer ceramic capacitors for automotive use - the NFM15HC105D0G3, which is the world's smallest 0402 size (1.00.5mm) three-terminal low-ESL multilayer ceramic capacitor, and the NFM18HC106D0G3, which is the three-terminal low-ESL multilayer ceramic capacitor with the world's highest capacitance of 10F in 0603 size (1.60.8mm), suitable for ADAS and autonomous driving.The second-ranked Samsung Electro-Mechanics by MLCC market share in the world (ranking fourth in the automotive MLCC market with about 6% share) has followed suit over the recent years, like squeezing out low-end capacity and stepping up the deployment of high-end products. In July 2020, the company developed five new types of MLCCs, including three types for power systems and two types for anti-lock braking systems, which will be available to global automakers in future. Besides building a dedicated automotive production line at the Busan plant, Samsung Electro-Mechanics is pressing ahead with construction of a new plant in Tianjin, China.Given its inferiority in MLCCs for consumer electronics, TDK cancelled orders for 700 million MLCCs covering about 360 models, and committed itself to mid-to-high-end products in 2017 as the first one aggressively exploring the automotive MLCC market, where TDK now seizes about 25% shares.MLCC vendors in Mainland China have been developing by leaps and bounds in recent years, especially Fenghua Advanced Technology is one of few Chinese MLCC vendors offering a full range of MLCCs covering 01005-2220 and above sizes with advantages in production scale and technical processes; but it still targets consumer electronics. In 2018, the company launched products in line with the AEC-Q200 standard, but still posing no threat to Japanese and Korean peers due to its weak foundation.Since 2018, traditional automakers worldwide have begun to deploy electric vehicle manufacturing on a large scale, and the governments have introduced timetables for elimination of ICE vehicle. As the number of MLCCs used in an electric vehicle is 6 times that in an ordinary car, MLCCs are bound to be much sought after. Hundreds of carmakers require automotive MLCCs which are only offered by a few automotive MLCC vendors, inevitably leading to the tight supply of automotive MLCCs in the next two years or three, and a big challenge to any automaker who is in readiness for capacity expansion of electric vehicles and even a mission impossible for emerging automakers because leading MLCC suppliers will give priority to key automakers. The MLCCs from tier-II suppliers as a last resort may cause quality issues and enormous maintenance costs.Global and China Multi-layer Ceramic Capacitor (MLCC) Industry Report, 2020-2026 highlights the following:MLCC industry (definition, classification, industry chain, technology trend, etc.); Global and Chinese MLCC markets (size and forecast, competitive landscape, market segments, etc.); Automotive MLCC market (size and forecast, competition pattern, etc.); Leading automotive MLCC vendors in China and beyond (profile, operation, business, new products, etc.); Upstream MLCC formula vendors (profile, operation, business, new products, etc.)Key Topics Covered: 1.

A philanthropic project that aims to raise money to support members of the music industry whose art and careers were put on hold by the pandemic, ""I know What Love Is"" will be available January 21 for download and streaming across multiple music platforms, including Apple Music, Spotify and Amazon Music. The song, written by Keith Goodwin and co-produced by Jay Parkin of Taylor Guitars, and audio engineer Gabriel O'Brien, will also feature a music video with footage of all 50+ artists. Net proceeds from the song will benefit MusiCares, a charity founded by the Recording Academy® (GRAMMY Awards®), which provides a support system of health and human services for music people across a spectrum of needs including physical and mental health, addiction recovery, hearing clinics, unforeseen personal emergencies, and disaster relief including COVID-19 relief. Taylor has also partnered with renowned music organizations The NAMM Foundation and Nettwerk Music Group to help promote the song and its positive message. Various Taylor artists will give an exclusive live performance of ""I Know What Love Is'' as part of NAMM's Believe In Music Week.Taylor® Guitars, Zac Brown, KT Tunstall, Jason Mraz And More Join To Create Uplifting Anthem “I Know What Love Is”Taylor® Guitars, Zac Brown, KT Tunstall, Jason Mraz Join To Create Uplifting Anthem ""I Know What Love Is""Tweet thisOne community that has been acutely affected by the COVID pandemic has been the music industry. The suspension of live music performances has created a domino effect, throttling the livelihoods of working musicians, road crews, staff at music venues and many others who contribute to the industry's ecosystem. The lack of live performances has also amplified the extended sense of social disconnection being felt everywhere. Yet music has always played an essential role in helping people get through tough times and creating a deeper sense of connection to others and the world around them. According to Keith Goodwin, singer, guitarist and songwriter from the indie folk band Good Old War, that's exactly the spirit that was channeled when he wrote the lyrics and melody for ""I Know What Love Is."" Goodwin's music was underscored with added poignancy when, soon after the recording of the song, he lost his grandmother, Madeline Lanni, from COVID-19 complications.""During lockdown one of the most challenging things for me was trying to adapt to not having my friends around to play music with,"" said Goodwin. ""This project really helped keep me focused on making music when everything else in life had changed so drastically. I'm grateful for this opportunity to connect and collaborate with such great artists and for a good cause. We are all lucky to be able to share our love of music together.""Goodwin collaborated with Taylor Guitars content producer Jay Parkin and producer/engineer Gabriel O'Brien to bring the song together, mix and master the original skeleton of the song. But after hearing the finished product, they decided that something was missing. In his role as producer, Parkin realized the song could be even bigger.""We were shooting for a 'Hey Jude' meets 'We Are the World' vibe,"" Parkin explains. ""The song itself felt good, but this was always about supporting musicians and bringing people together. Once we started reaching out to the music community and began to get the parts back, we started to see how the pieces all fit together to create an anthem of hope for 2021.""Goodwin and Parkin drew on their connections to the music industry to enlist dozens of Taylor players for the project, from hobbyists and weekend warriors to touring bands and big-label acts. Each artist was asked to contribute their own version of a piece of the song that spoke to them. Zac Brown, Jason Mraz, KT Tunstall, Chris Conley (Saves the Day), Alana Springsteen and 49 others enthusiastically collaborated via email, creating over 200 tracks recorded in their respective home studios around the world, from Los Angeles and Nashville to Tokyo, responding to the song's inspiring message of solidarity among the music community during a time of great need. In addition to audio tracks, the artists and performers also captured their parts on video using iPhones and DSLR cameras to create the ""I Know What Love Is"" music video, a tribute to community, connection, technology and the power of music. With those contributions in hand, Goodwin, Parkin and O'Brien then spent hundreds of hours working across time zones to assemble, edit, mix and master a new version of the song, this one composed of sounds drawn from musicians across borders and genres. ""So many brilliantly talented crew, venue teams and artists have been financially crippled by the arrival of COVID-19, and hopefully we can ease some of that pain a little through MusiCares,"" says KT Tunstall, the GRAMMY-winning Scottish singer-songwriter and musician.Among the respected music institutions that have joined the effort to promote ""I Know What Love Is'' and its message of positivity are The NAMM Foundation, a not-for-profit association with a mission to strengthen the music products industry, and Nettwerk Music Group, an organization that connects music fans with music makers. Nettwerk Music Group will release the song and provide promotional support, while The NAMM Foundation will host an exclusive live stream performance at NAMM's Believe in Music week on January 21, 2021, at 9:30 a.m. PST. Visit https://attend.believeinmusic.tv to register. ""'I Know What Love Is' offers a message of hope and resilience that through music is a way forward,"" shares Mary Luehrsen, Executive Director of The NAMM Foundation. ""While we continue to navigate these times for our industry and society, the gift of music is a wellspring that ripples throughout communities and undoubtedly will help those most in need."" ""I Know What Love Is'' will be available to stream and download January 21, on major music platforms Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music and more.

IMDFaaS's proprietary technology and development expertise make acquiring high quality IMDF archives fast, simple and affordable for any sized venue or facility. Whether enabling wayfinding through a new medical campus, delivering contactless personalized experiences for shoppers, guiding first responders in emergency situations within large buildings or helping COOs optimize their workforce, IMDFaaS makes it easy for organizations to unlock new indoor intelligence while delivering innovative experiences for customers, visitors and employees. Led by one of the world's leading experts in architecturally sophisticated IMDF creation, Judd Swanson, IMDFaaS is revolutionizing the IMDF development process to accelerate indoor mapping applications. ""IMDF as a standardized, open format changes everything for indoor mapping by preventing siloed ecosystems or proprietary formats that lock you in to one vendor or constrain your indoor maps to a single function,"" said Swanson, SVP geospatial and indoor positioning at IMDFaaS. ""Plus, indoor mapping has been cost prohibitive for most enterprises because there was no efficient way to create the high-quality files needed for end use applications. Now, any organization has the potential to deliver new customer experiences quickly or optimize their workflow within any indoor space. Nobody is providing IMDF as a service like we are."" Traditionally, acquiring an IMDF archive was difficult, complex, expensive and typically meant being locked into a closed format that limited the functionality of the indoor map. IMDFaaS has revolutionized the process with straightforward pricing and a turnkey experience that only requires a customer-provided a dimensioned drawing or floorplan of their building or indoor space. IMDFaaS's team of geospatial experts utilize a proprietary software that automates much of the manual effort otherwise required to translate those files into an accurate and open IMDF archive, exponentially accelerating the process while maintaining detail and precision. As an indoor space changes, the 'service' element of IMDFaaS provides quick modifications to the customer's IMDF package at no additional cost, ensuring their indoor space's digital twin remains accurate.IMDFaaS's open-format, high quality IMDF archives are guaranteed to comply with Apple validation requirements for the enablement of Apple Indoor Positioning (IPS), streamlining time to value and integration with iOS applications. IPS leverages an IMDF archive to enable accurate indoor location awareness on any iPhone or iPad with no need for additional hardware infrastructure. Apple Indoor Positioning is integrated into the CoreLocation service enabling a seamless transition between indoor and outdoor positioning, bringing GPS-level functionality and user experience indoors.The global indoor positioning and navigation market is expected to grow from a market value of $6.92 billion in 2017 to $23.6 billion by 2023. To empower faster adoption of indoor mapping by eliminating indoor mapping format confusion, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), comprised of the world's leading geospatial researchers, product developers and users, is considering IMDF as a Community Standard. OGC members Apple, Autodesk Esri, Google and others have shared their support for the adoption.

Gym closures and home isolation has led people to look for alternative ways to exercise at home. Home fitness equipment, such as weights and exercise bikes, are in enormous demand. Fitness equipment companies reported a 600% sales surge during the summer, and popular items are in short supply. However, it is not easy to exercise at home. People want to buy multiple machines to replicate the physical variety of the gym, but fitness machines require considerable space. People can only buy the equipment that they have room for in their home. Another downside of home fitness compared to the gym is the lack of human connection and encouragement that coaches or fellow athletes would normally provide. Experience a new way to work out at homeStride is here to offer a complete gym experience in this new era of home fitness. Targeting customers who have aspirational health and fitness goals, are space-constrained, and motivationally challenged, Stride offers a multi-use connected fitness machine called Transformer. This machine can be transformed between ergonomically correct modes: biking, running, rowing, and cabled strength. Stride-Transformer does all of this while only taking up the space of a single treadmill. Fitting four exercise modes in a small space without compromising on physical comfort makes Stride truly unique in the market. But just offering physical fitness variety in a small space was not enough. The Stride team did extensive market research discovering that motivation is the most common challenge people have with home fitness. As a companion to the Transformer machine, Stride-360, a digital fitness platform, was developed to offer motivational support. This app significantly boosts user engagement using visual goal and progress tracking, social connectivity with peers, and a wide variety of instructor support.The digital platform is enhanced by capturing data from Stride-Transformer. Smart sensors in the machine record exercise parameters and upload the data to the Stride-360 app. Besides the machine sensors, users will eventually be able to connect their favorite fitness trackers to the platform. Users can use this data in combination with teams they form to compete and support each other, creating a more enjoyable, gamified social experience. To ensure fitness variety, the platform leverages user and trainer generated content like Youtube. Stride has a program to collaborate with trainers around the world. The program supports trainers who aspire to expand their online presence by offering detailed audience insights, and the opportunity to do brand promotion. Trainers will also be able to receive short-term compensation when they refer Transformer machine sales, supporting hardware expansion. This short term revenue is paired with long term revenue from content creation. The revenue models align with the desire to offer users the voices and content that speak to them.Overall the two offerings are revolutionary. Transformer offers more fitness in less space. The app, Stride-360 has a wide variety of user-generated content that can act in a standalone capacity for platform users who choose not to buy the machine right away. For Stride this means a hybrid business model with the revenue coming not only from machine sales but also a digital subscription. Used together or separately, Stride offers the best of home fitness.Stride uses innovative technology to create a tailored fitness experience.Stride is the first and only connected multi-use exercise machine. You can get a complete cardio and strength workout while also experiencing human connection. The hybrid business model of selling a modular, choose-what-you-want machine, connected to a platform that lets a variety of voices speak to a variety of people is truly innovative. This flexible format platform the founders refer to as open social fitness allows Stride to capture a more complete data based view of users' activities. This data will help Stride to suggest improvements to users allowing them to achieve more controlled and customizable goals.Putting together an amazing team for users' amazing experienceStride was founded by Joseph Prosnitz and cofounder Alexander Kuzmin. The duo combine their passion for physical activity, professional experience in metal manufacturing, app development and electrical engineering to create Stride. Stride's current achievements include issued and ongoing patents for space saving E-Motion drive train technology and the newly launched alpha of the Stride-360 Android app.The next big milestones for Stride is the manufacturing of the first Transformer production sample and iPhone app release in January 2021.Stride makes home fitness more exciting, encouraging and social, and Taiwan Tech Arena (TTA) is happy to select it as one of the 100 featured Taiwanese startups to showcase at CES 2021.CES 2021 TTA-VR Pavilion: https://pse.is/3bgdua SOURCE STRIDE-360"

It analyses GDP proportion, expenditure per capita, consumer electronics repair and maintenance indicators comparison.The consumer electronics repair and maintenance market consists of sales of consumer electronics repair and maintenance services by entities (organizations, sole traders and partnerships) that are engaged in repairing and maintaining consumer electronics such as televisions, stereos, speakers, video recorders, CD and DVD players, radios, and cameras, without retailing new consumer electronics. Only goods and services traded between entities or sold to end consumers are included.North America was the largest region in the consumer electronics repair and maintenance market in 2019. Asia-Pacific is expected to be the fastest-growing region in the forecast period.The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the consumer electronics repair and maintenance industry as governments across the globe have imposed lockdowns and put restrictions on non-essential services to prevent the spread of the virus. Repair and maintenance services hugely depend on labor and the availability of labor during this pandemic is a big challenge. The repair industry across countries such as US, the UK, Germany, Italy, the Middle East and India have also witnessed an increase in labor cost due to labor shortages in the lockdown. The repairing industry, in general, fixes around 25 million electronic appliances in a month, but due to lockdown and social distancing norms, the products are expected to pile up for repair. Besides, the supply chain disruptions in various countries have made it difficult to find spare components for mobile and other electronic appliances making consumers wait longer for availing services.The consumer electronics repair and maintenance market covered in this report is segmented by type into consumer electronics; home appliances; medical equipment; industrial equipment. It is also segmented by service type into in-warranty; out of warranty and by end-user into industrial/commercial; residential.An increase in equipment failure rates and cost benefits of repairing old equipment rather than disposing of them are expected to drive the consumer electronics repair and maintenance market. The branded and non-branded low-cost products regularly flood the market and need repair in some time as they are made with poor quality material or due to regular maintenance. However, research suggests that companies are now taking a different approach, which is building products that could be easily repaired for use as fixing an issue in a gadget is always a cost-effective solution than buying a new one, thereby enhancing the trust of the customer. Customers tend to buy and refer the products of the company that offers repair manual, spare parts and provide assistance and guidance on fixing the product. Apple has begun assembling the older iPhone in India. Companies like iFixit and Repair Cafe are bringing people together to work for repairing devices. The European Commission is all set to discuss eco-design regulation for smartphones from 2021, including access to spare parts and repair information.Key Topics Covered: 1. Executive Summary 2.

For a faster and more efficient application, the iXflash Cube only backs up images and content that are not yet loaded onto the iXflash Cube.This incredibly innovative startup was selected by Taiwan Tech Arena (TTA) as one of the 100 featured Taiwanese startups showcased at CES 2021.Backing up your data is much easier than before with the iXflash CubeThe iXflash Cube can serve two important functions at once, and all without complicated programming or setup. Firstly, the iXflash Cube automatically backs up all of your Apple iOS mobile device's photo albums (all formats of photos and videos in their original state) as well as other stored content. Plus, all of the content backed up to the iXflash Cube is transferrable to any other storage device with a Lightning or USB connection.

The app allows the iXflash Cube to accurately back up all photos, videos, contacts, and other files in their native state without alterations or reductions in resolution, and safely stores them on the iXflash Cube,"" said Shuo Wei Chang, Waytech Media Founder and General Manager.Chang said that, although 70 million mobile phones are lost each year, only 20% of people use any type of backup for their mobile devices.He said that, while the cloud provides a solution for backing up data, cloud services require payment of a monthly fee. Also, hackers can steal information from the cloud, creating privacy issues. When it comes to backing up data, Chang noted that redundancy is good – using both the cloud and a physical backup device gives added protection.""The iXflash Cube sets itself apart from the competition in several ways. The device is MFi certified, meaning it has passed Apple's stringent quality control guidelines. It also is operated using an extremely easy-to-use app. With the iXflash Cube, users simply plug the iOS device they want to back up and/or charge into the iXflash Cube using a standard charging cable and then connect that cable into an electrical outlet. The iXflash Cube and its app do the rest,"" he said.Compatible with the latest line of iPhone 12'sEvery year, Apple announces its latest batch of iPhones along with other new inventive items they plan make available to the general public. Due to disruptions because of COVID, the announcement was about a month later than normal, but the pomp and circumstances were still in full effect. Amongst the new and improved items that Apple plans to release now and in the near future are four new iPhone 12 models. The main difference among these models is their respective sizes. All, of course, offer advantages over previously released models.Given that the iXflash Cube is a tremendous accessory for an iPhone or iPad, the current iXflash Cube and the iXflash Cube app are compatible with the latest line of iPhone 12s. Waytech takes pride in making sure the iXflash Cube and its app remains at the leading edge of technology and offers its users the best and most reliable experience. Hence, it's critical that we make sure the iXflash Cube is up to date with all new and enhanced Apple iOS software and hardware. We recognize the importance not just of compatibility but also of any and all new advancements that could enhance the iXflash Cube's ability to support our client base. This is why the iXflash Cube is the most useful, portable Apple iOS accessory.Waytech Media is the leading manufacturer of digital duplication and storage equipment, with products ranging from optical discs to flash memory.

Insight is a leading software investor with over $30B AUM after announcing its 11th flagship fund, Fund XI at $9.5B in April, 2020. The investment, which brings RapidSOS's total funding to $200M, will advance the company's work to connect emergency data from digital health, smart buildings, security, connected vehicles, and app companies with first responders globally. The RapidSOS Platform powers 4,800+ Emergency Communications Centers (ECCs) across the US, covering 92% of the population, and is integrated with over 350 million connected devices. These devices, recognized as RapidSOS Ready, transmit real-time location, health and medical information, connected building and alarm data, and more in an emergency. ""2020 reminded all of us of the heroic work that first responders do in our most challenging moments,"" said Michael Martin, founder & CEO of RapidSOS. ""We spent the past eight years building the RapidSOS emergency response data platform in partnership with thousands of first responders — collaborating with leading technology companies to provide the right data, at the right place, at the right time to save lives across over 150 million emergencies annually."" The new funding supports RapidSOS's mission to link connected devices to first responders globally when we need it most — providing a life-saving ecosystem of safety, security, and digital health. For example, the RapidSOS Platform connects data from the following sources with 911 and first responders in an emergency: crash impact and occupant data from connected vehicles, critical health and medical information from medical profiles, wearables and devices, and alarm information, address, sensor data, and multimedia from connected buildings.""Insight has a history of backing category-defining companies, and RapidSOS has all the makings of one in the emergency response space,"" said Nikitas Koutoupes, Managing Director at Insight Partners. ""We are excited to have our team of software ScaleUp and platform experts help drive RapidSOS's mission.""2020: An Unprecedented Year for Emergency ResponseThis past year put a spotlight on the importance of faster and more effective emergency response. The need for critical, life-saving data was never more apparent than in 2020 when the world faced unprecedented emergencies, including the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, and domestic threats like the Christmas Day Nashville bombing. Data from the RapidSOS Platform was used in over 150 million emergencies during the calendar year (on average, 400,000+ per day) and in some cases became the critical link between citizens and first responders when traditional voice 911 circuits went down in major disasters or attacks. Facing the global pandemic, RapidSOS worked to accelerate the connectivity between health data and 911. Millions of Americans are able to share important medical information with 911 through the Medical ID feature on an iPhone. When a user chooses to set up the feature, the information is shared when making an emergency call or using the Emergency SOS feature, in supported regions. In addition, in collaboration with the American Red Cross, the American Heart Association, and Direct Relief, RapidSOS launched the Emergency Health Profile, a simple and free way for anyone to share their health data with 911. With the support of Insight Partners and existing investors, RapidSOS plans to accelerate its partnership with first responders globally, supporting their life-saving work with critical data from hundreds of millions of devices. About RapidSOS In partnership with public safety, RapidSOS has created the world's first emergency response data platform that securely links life-saving data from 350M+ connected devices to emergency services and first responders. Through the platform, RapidSOS provides intelligent data that supports over 4,800 Emergency Communications Centers worldwide, across 150 million emergencies in 2020. Together with innovative companies recognized as RapidSOS Ready, RapidSOS is supporting first responders in saving millions of lives annually.

At the end of the first year post-infusion with valoctocogene roxaparvovec, participants in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population (N=132) had a mean endogenous Factor VIII expression level of 42.9 (SD 45.5, median 23.9) IU/dL, as measured by the chromogenic substrate (CS) assay, supporting the marked clinical benefits observed with abrogation of bleeding episodes and Factor VIII infusion rate. Factor VIII expression declined at a slower rate compared to the Phase 1/2 study, and remained in a range to provide hemostatic efficacy. In a subset of the mITT population that had been dosed at least two years prior to the data cut date (N=17), Factor VIII expression declined from a mean of 42.2 (SD 50.9, median 23.9) IU/dL at the end of year one to a mean of 24.4 (SD 29.2, median 14.7) IU/dL at the end of year two with continued hemostatic efficacy demonstrated by a mean ABR of 0.9 (median 0.0) bleeding episodes per year.

Please see Figure 1: Box-and-Whiskers Plot.This is the first statistical evidence demonstrating ABR superiority in a gene therapy trial. These data give us confidence in this groundbreaking alternative to existing therapies and bring us one step closer to a potential new treatment choice to fulfill an unmet medical need for people with hemophilia A,"" said Steven W. Pipe, MD, Professor of Pediatrics and Pathology, Coagulation Director, Special Coagulation Laboratory Laurence A. Boxer, MD Research Professor of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases Department of Pathology Michigan Medicine at the University of Michigan and investigator in the Phase 3 study. ""This data set adds to the growing body of scientific and clinical data around valoctocogene roxaparvovec gene therapy for hemophilia A and creates the possibility for a new treatment paradigm.""""Over the past seven years, we have conducted rigorous scientific research and clinical programs to address the unmet medical needs of people with severe hemophilia A,"" said Hank Fuchs, M.D., President of Worldwide Research and Development at BioMarin. ""The decades-long aspirations of the hemophilia community are at the forefront of our ongoing commitment to advance this promising investigational gene therapy for the treatment of severe hemophilia A. We are very encouraged by these data and look forward to working with regulatory authorities, treating physicians, and people with hemophilia A to further understand the potential of this gene therapy."" ""Although factor replacement therapy has been shown to be a safe and effective treatment modality in hemophilia, it suffers both from incomplete prevention of joint disease and having a high treatment burden with recurring needs for intravenous infusions, which can limit important daily activities out of fear of bleeds,"" said Guy Young, M.D., Director, Hemostasis and Thrombosis Program at Children's Hospital Los Angeles and Professor of Pediatrics (Clinical Scholar), Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California. ""Novel therapeutic approaches such as gene therapy offer the prospect for both complete prevention of bleeds and subsequent joint damage and eliminating the burden associated with current treatments resulting in an improved quality of life."" Valoctocogene Roxaparvovec SafetyOverall, in the Phase 3 study, valoctocogene roxaparvovec has been well tolerated by the 134 participants who received a single 6e13 vg/kg dose. No participants developed inhibitors to Factor VIII, or thromboembolic events. One participant was lost to follow-up. Infusion-related reactions were effectively mitigated by managing infusion rates.Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation (115 participants, 86%), a laboratory test of liver function, remained the most common adverse event (AE). Other common adverse events were headache (51 participants, 38%), nausea (50 participants, 37%), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation (47 participants, 35%), arthralgia (38 participants, 28%) and fatigue (37 participants, 27%). Twenty-two (16.4%) participants experienced a total of 43 serious adverse events (SAEs), and all SAEs resolved. Common, steroid-related side effects can occur with temporary use of corticosteroid (or alternative immunosuppressants) to manage ALT elevation. These side effects have generally been grade 1/2 in intensity, manageable and reversible. Isolated grade 3 steroid-related sides effects (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, weight gain, bone fractures) were observed with longer-term higher dose corticosteroid administration. Corticosteroid-related grade 3 SAEs emerged as a safety issue with extended use of corticosteroids which were reversible with only one event of weight gain ongoing. Overall, in the Phase 1/2 study, the safety profile of valoctocogene roxaparvovec remains consistent with previously reported data with no delayed-onset, treatment-related events. No participants developed inhibitors to Factor VIII, and no participants withdrew from the study. No participants have developed thrombotic events. The most common adverse events associated with valoctocogene roxaparvovec occurred early and included transient infusion-associated reactions and transient, asymptomatic, and mild to moderate rise in the levels of certain proteins and enzymes measured in liver function tests with no long-lasting clinical sequelae. GENEr8-1 Study DescriptionThe global Phase 3 GENEr8-1 study evaluates superiority of valoctocogene roxaparvovec at the 6e13 vg/kg dose compared to the current standard of care, FVIII prophylactic therapy. All study participants had severe hemophilia A at baseline, defined as less than or equal to 1 IU/dL of Factor VIII activity. The study included 134 total participants, all of whom had a minimum of 12 months of follow-up at the time of the datacut. The first 22 participants were directly enrolled into the Phase 3 study, 17 of whom were HIV-negative and dosed at least 2 years prior to the datacut date (referred to as the subset). The remaining 112 participants (rollover population) completed at least six months in a separate non-interventional study to prospectively assess bleeding episodes, Factor VIII use, and health-related quality of life while receiving Factor VIII prophylaxis prior to rolling over to receive a single infusion of valoctocogene roxaparvovec in the GENEr8-1 study.Regulatory StatusBioMarin is working with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to align on steps forward to obtain marketing approval for valoctocogene roxaparvovec gene therapy for severe hemophilia A. The FDA recommended that the Company complete the Phase 3 study and submit two-year follow-up safety and efficacy data on all study participants. Additionally, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) requested one-year results from the full Phase 3 study to inform their benefit-risk assessment. To facilitate this submission within the EMA regulatory framework, BioMarin withdrew the MAA and plans to resubmit the MAA with these data to the EMA in the second quarter of 2021 following discussions with the Agency.The FDA has granted valoctocogene roxaparvovec Breakthrough Therapy Designation. BioMarin's valoctocogene roxaparvovec has received orphan drug designation from the FDA and EMA for the treatment of severe hemophilia A. The Orphan Drug Designation program is intended to advance the evaluation and development of products that demonstrate promise for the diagnosis and/or treatment of rare diseases or conditions.

Phase 1/2 Dose Escalation Study DescriptionThe Phase 1/2 dose escalation study is ongoing and continues to monitor participants long-term. In the study, a total of 15 patients with severe hemophilia A and Factor VIII activity levels less than or equal to 1 IU/dL received a single dose of BMN 270, seven of whom were treated at a dose of 6e13 vg/kg and six of whom were treated at a lower dose of 4e13 vg/kg. The other two participants were treated at lower doses as part of dose escalation in the study and did not achieve therapeutic efficacy. Robust Clinical ProgramBioMarin has multiple clinical studies underway in its comprehensive gene therapy program for the treatment of severe hemophilia A. In addition to the global Phase 3 study GENEr8-1 and the ongoing Phase 1/2 dose escalation study, the Company recently began enrolling participants in a Phase 3b, single arm, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of valoctocogene roxaparvovec at a dose of 6e13 vg/kg with prophylactic corticosteroids in people with hemophilia A. The Company is running a Phase 1/2 Study with the 6e13kg/vg dose of valoctocogene roxaparvovec in approximately 10 participants with pre-existing AAV5 antibodies, as well as another Phase 1/2 Study with the 6e13 vg/kg dose of valoctocogene roxaparvovec in people with hemophilia A with active or prior FVIII inhibitors. About Hemophilia APeople living with hemophilia A lack sufficient functioning Factor VIII protein to help their blood clot and are at risk for painful and/or potentially life-threatening bleeds from even modest injuries. Additionally, people with the most severe form of hemophilia A (FVIII levels <1%) often experience painful, spontaneous bleeds into their muscles or joints. Individuals with the most severe form of hemophilia A make up approximately 50 percent of the hemophilia A population. People with hemophilia A with moderate (FVIII 1-5%) or mild (FVIII 5-40%) disease show a much-reduced propensity to bleed. The standard of care for individuals with severe hemophilia A is a prophylactic regimen of replacement Factor VIII infusions administered intravenously up to two to three times per week or 100 to 150 infusions per year. Despite these regimens, many people continue to experience breakthrough bleeds, resulting in progressive and debilitating joint damage, which can have a major impact on their quality of life. Hemophilia A, also called Factor VIII deficiency or classic hemophilia, is an X-linked genetic disorder caused by missing or defective Factor VIII, a clotting protein. Although it is passed down from parents to children, about 1/3 of cases are caused by a spontaneous mutation, a new mutation that was not inherited. Approximately 1 in 10,000 people have Hemophilia A.

The new BRAVIA XR televisions include MASTER Series Z9J 8K LED, MASTER Series A90J and A80J OLED, and X95J and X90J 4K LED.Sony BRAVIA XR LineupPowered by the Cognitive Processor XR, the brain of the new BRAVIA XR, the televisions use a completely new processing method designed to replicate the ways humans see and hear. When we see objects, we unconsciously focus on certain points. Cognitive Processor XR, powered by cognitive intelligence, divides the screen into numerous zones and detects where the ""focal point"" is in the picture. While conventional Artificial Intelligence (AI) can only detect and analyze picture elements like color, contrast and detail individually, the new processor can cross-analyze an array of elements at once, just as our brains do. By doing so, each element is adjusted to its best final outcome, in conjunction with each other, so everything is synchronized and lifelike – something that conventional AI cannot achieve.Cognitive Processor XR can also analyze sound position in the signal so the sound matches precisely with what's on the screen. In addition, it upconverts any sound to 3D surround sound, to deliver supreme realism with an immersive soundscape. It learns, analyzes and understands unprecedented amounts of data and intelligently optimizes every pixel, frame and scene for the most lifelike picture and sound Sony has ever delivered.""Sony's goal is to offer viewers the best and most immersive experience – authentically delivering the creator's true intent,"" said Mike Fasulo, president and chief operating officer of Sony Electronics, Inc. ""Our new BRAVIA CORE technology and the XR lineup takes the industry to the next level with a powerful, cinematic experience, enabled by the world's first TVs with cognitive processors1.""Key BRAVIA XR Lineup Highlights:BRAVIA CORE™: In collaboration with Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE), BRAVIA CORE™ is where entertainment meets technology and was developed to add value and showcase unique Sony experiences.

Users can even add to their Watchlist from their phone or laptop with Google Search. HDMI 2.1 Compatibility: All BRAVIA XR TVs will feature HDMI 2.1 compatibility, including 4K 120fps, Variable Refresh Rate (VRR)5, Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM) and e-ARC, supporting higher resolutions and frame rates ideal for next-generation gaming. Sound-from-Picture Reality™: In addition to best-in-class picture quality, the new Cognitive Processor XR also offers incredible sound with Sound-from-Picture Reality™, which aligns the position of the sound with the images on the screen to offer a uniquely lifelike experience. Hands-Free Voice Function: With hands-free voice control built into Sony's Google TVs6, you can set aside the remote and just use your voice to search for entertainment, get answers, and control the TV and smart home devices. Try saying ""Hey Google, turn on the TV"" or ""Hey Google, what should I watch?""

""AI-based personalized fall detection,More news about: FallCall Solutions","FallCall Solutions","TRUMBULL, Conn., Jan. 7, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- FallCall Solutions announced it will release FallCall Detect, patented technology that combines the power of smart fall detection with a comprehensive personal emergency response system (PERS). The technology will be showcased at CES 2021 in the AARP Innovation Labs booth from January 11-14.Continue ReadingSmart Fall Detection Plus Personal Emergency Response SystemNot every fall requires medical help, yet standard fall detection systems often trigger emergency alerts whenever a fall is detected. FallCall Detect's breakthrough technology distinguishes between falls with greater force that are more likely to cause injury and falls that occur from a sitting position. If a high-impact fall is detected, FallCall's U.S.-based medical monitoring service is automatically contacted* and will send emergency services if needed. If a low-impact fall is detected, only a user's pre-designated support community is contacted.Available as an Apple Watch app, FallCall Detect allows Elders greater freedom and confidence to live independent, active lifestyles knowing they will receive immediate help if they experience a fall. They can also rest easy knowing there is reduced chance of setting off unnecessary emergency service activations.According to the National Council on Aging, falls are the leading cause of fatality for older adults, with one dying from a fall every 19 minutes. FallCall Solutions, which was founded by physicians specializing in trauma care who have treated thousands of fall victims, is out to radically reduce that number. The company aims to leverage the increasing adoption of smart technology by Elders to encourage greater use of medical alert services.""Several older adults I've treated for falls owned a medical alert device but didn't use it. They said it was too bulky, stigmatizing or inconvenient, and they've experienced embarrassing false alarms,"" says FallCall Solutions co-founder Dr. Shea Gregg. ""By offering simple, safe and smart technology combined with PERS capabilities on an Apple Watch they already wear, we believe we will have much greater adoption, daily usage and earlier treatment of fall injuries.""FallCall Detect connects to FallCall Solution's platform-agnostic emergency assistant app that provides a user's support community with fall alerts, location, heart rate and battery updates, and pairs with FallCall's affordable medical monitoring service. Once activated, users receive non-invasive, on-demand fall detection with 1-tap emergency response activation and deactivation, as well as the option to use voice commands on Apple Watch, iPhone or HomePod.""Differentiated smart fall detection is only the beginning for FallCall Solutions,"" says Dr. Gregg. ""AI-based personalized fall detection, fall motion learning in the cloud and nighttime fall prediction risk will all be coming to our platform in the near future.

The quoting and trading of the Company's common stock on the OTC Marketplace is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with the Company's operations or business prospects. As a result, there may be volatility in the market price of the shares of the Company's common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTC Marketplace is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on it is often more sporadic than trading of securities listed on a national securities exchange. Accordingly, stockholders may have difficulty reselling any of their shares.

Patients will experience smart rooms that allow them to connect with their care team and control devices like the television – all hands-free.Alexa, the voice assistant used by millions of Americans at home for convenience, is being implemented in 2,500 hospital rooms for patients across 14 BayCare hospitals.

BayCare hopes to have the technology in place across its entire system by the end of 2021.According to BayCare Director of Innovation Craig Anderson, BayCare will have the largest deployment of Aiva technology for a U.S. health system. ""This is bringing consumer-friendly technology into the medical space to provide the same value we get every day from our voice-assistants like Alexa,"" he said.BayCare uses the Aiva platform to handle patient requests and provide hands-free room control. The Aiva product is easy to use for the patient. For example, they can just say what they need and their request will be instantly routed to the BayCare iPhone of the appropriate care team or patient care technician via PatientTouch, BayCare's clinical communication and collaboration tool. Nurses and other staff can immediately send a voice message back to the patient, alerting them that their request has been received.Aiva is a Los Angeles-based voice operating system that runs on Amazon's Alexa for Business infrastructure on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to help patients and assist clinicians and medical staff. ""The patient can simply ask Alexa for anything they need like a blanket or a glass of water,"" Anderson said. ""Aiva interprets all those requests and sends it to right person. It is a seamless connection between the patient and their care team.""The technology was piloted at BayCare's St. Joseph's Hospital in Tampa and Winter Haven Hospital in 2019 before being put in use at St. Joseph's Hospital-North in late 2020. Patients were highly satisfied with the Aiva technology in surveys during the pilot, Anderson said.""Millions of Americans use voice assistants for comfort and convenience at home,"" said St. Joseph's Hospital-North president Tom Garthwaite. ""As part of the consumerization of health care, people are increasingly looking for that same kind of experience during a hospital stay.""Aiva has also integrated with the hospital room television through the GetWellNetwork patient experience platform. With a simple voice request, patients can ask Alexa to turn on a particular television channel and control the volume. Nurses are also able to use the Aiva technology to show specific education videos to patients on the television.Anderson said BayCare plans to eventually provide hands-free control of an entire hospital room.""Our goal is to make an entire smart hospital room,"" Anderson said. ""Through voice commands you can ask for anything you need, you can get any entertainment you want, control the television, Technologies that are now standard in some homes now will now be available in the hospital room.""With the Aiva platform, patients can also ask Alexa to play music, or provide news, information, weather, trivia and sports updates. If a patient prefers not to use Alexa, they can mute the device. ""Aiva not only instantly bridged the communication between patients and the care team, it also provided more ways for them to interact,"" said Anna Giles, a Winter Haven Hospital registered nurse who used the technology during the pilot. ""The ability to play games and provide a vast spectrum of music choices provided comfort to patients,"" Giles said. ""We're excited to see how this technology grows to benefit patients' well-being in the future.""""We're excited to partner with BayCare,"" said Aiva founder and Chief Executive Officer Sumeet Bhatia, ""We've always felt that the best health care technology does its work in the background, giving clinicians more freedom and patients more control.""About St. Joseph's Hospital-North St. Joseph's Hospital-North opened in February 2010 to bring high-quality health care services to North Tampa in an environment designed to help patients heal.

On G2 Tesorio has earned the highest rankings in five out of seven criteria in the AR Automation Software category. The company scored a 9.7 for ease of use, 9.7 for ease of setup, 9.8 in quality of support, and perfect 10s for ease of doing business with and product direction. Additionally, Tesorio was recognized as a major player in its debut in the IDC MarketScape: Worldwide SaaS and Cloud-Enabled Accounts Receivable Automation Applications for Midmarket report. Finally, the company's net promoter score has surged to 60, which is near twice the SaaS industry average of 31.""At Tesorio we understand that CFOs and their teams want tools that get the job done reliably, efficiently, and quickly. This is why we focus so heavily on ease of use and time to value,"" said Carlos Vega, Tesorio's chief executive.

""CFOs and their finance teams make a discerning customer base and they value pragmatism and productivity far more than frivolous bells and whistles,"" said Jay Gaines, SVP Marketing at Tesorio. ""This is why our customer advisory board has the loudest and most listened to voice in the company.

""As the saying goes, ""a rising tide lifts all boats"", but a year like 2020 reminded us that consistent innovation requires a strong product vision and a sustainable business model,"" said Vega. ""Last year we saw recent market entrants and incumbents get acquired after struggling to raise funds and the oldest player trying to shoehorn an adapted enterprise product into a dynamic, cloud-based mid-market. Tesorio has emerged as the only independent company in the space originally built for and exclusively focused on serving the mid-market. ""The mid-market AR automation space is riddled with companies offering products that are either overly complex and too difficult to implement because they were originally designed as on-premise solutions for vast enterprises, or are limited by a vision that starts and ends with simply automating legacy processes,"" said Carlos Vega. ""One of these companies was recently acquired by a postal company to enhance their own presence in the document process automation space and that says a lot about how they view AR Automation. At Tesorio we view effective collections as central to how our customers create great customer experiences, and foundational to them achieving true cash flow performance,"" Vega continued. ""We are extremely gratified to have our customers give us a perfect ten for product direction on G2, and we know that reflects the fact that we view our platform as doing more than simply automating the work that finance teams had previously done manually. That perfect ten isn't just about being better. It's about being different. It reflects our partnership with our customers to help them achieve a whole new level and type of positive influence and execution for their businesses. We see a future where finance teams not only see what's happening with their cash flow but are also empowered to take effective action instantly.

""Aiva interprets all those requests and sends it to right person. It is a seamless connection between the patient and their care team.""The technology was piloted at St. Joseph's Hospital in Tampa and Winter Haven Hospital in 2019 before being put in use at St. Joseph's Hospital-North in late 2020. Patients were highly satisfied with the Aiva technology in surveys during the pilot, Anderson said.""Millions of Americans use voice assistants for comfort and convenience at home,"" said St. Joseph's Hospital-North president Tom Garthwaite. ""Bringing this technology to the hospital room will help many people feel more comfortable, which ultimately supports their recovery.""Currently, Aiva also enables patients to control the hospital room television via Alexa. With a simple voice request, patients can request a particular television channel and control the volume.Anderson said BayCare plans for the Aiva technology to eventually control an entire room.""Our goal is to make an entire smart hospital room,"" Anderson said. ""Through voice commands you can ask for anything you need, you can get any entertainment you want, control the television, room lighting and temperature. Controlling window blinds is also potentially an option for the future. Technologies that are now standard in some homes will be available in the hospital room.""The Aiva technology using Alexa in hospital rooms also allows users to play music and ask for news, information, weather, trivia and sports updates.If a patient prefers not to use Alexa, they can mute the device.""Aiva not only instantly bridged communication between patients and the care team , it also provided more ways for them to interact,"" said Anna Giles, a Winter Haven Hospital registered nurse who used the technology during the pilot.""The ability to play games and provide a vast spectrum of music choices provided comfort to patients in unique ways,"" Giles said. ""We're excited to see how this technology grows to benefit patients' well-being in the future.""""We're excited to partner with BayCare,"" said Sumeet Bhatia, founder and chief executive officer of Aiva. ""We've always felt that the best health care technology does its work in the background, giving clinicians more freedom and patients more control.""Anderson said BayCare will have the largest deployment of Aiva technology using Alexa for a U.S. health system.""This is bringing consumer-friendly technology into the medical space to provide the same value we get every day from our voice-assistants like Alexa,"" he said.About St. Joseph's Hospital-NorthSt. Joseph's Hospital-North opened in February 2010 to bring high-quality health care services to North Tampa in an environment designed to help patients heal.
