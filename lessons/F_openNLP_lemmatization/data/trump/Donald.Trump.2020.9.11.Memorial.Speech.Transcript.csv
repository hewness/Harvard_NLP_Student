"Donald Trump","On that September morning when America was under attack, the battle turned in the skies above this field. Soon after taking off from Newark, New Jersey, radical Islamic terrorists seized control of United 93. Other hijacked planes struck the North tower of the World Trade Center, and then the South tower, and then the Pentagon. The terrorists on Flight 93 had a fourth target in mind, it was called our nation’s capitol.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-2020-9-11-memorial-speech-transcript","Donald Trump 2020 9/11 Memorial Speech Transcript","02:15"

"Donald Trump","Every passenger and crew member on the plane had a life filled with love and joy, friends and family, radiant hopes and limitless dreams. When the plane was hijacked, they called their families and learned that America was also under attack. Then they faced the most fateful moment of their lives. Through the heartache and the tears, they prayed to God, they placed their last calls home, they whispered the immortal words, I love you. Today, those words ring out across these sacred grounds and they shine down on us from Heaven above.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-2020-9-11-memorial-speech-transcript","Donald Trump 2020 9/11 Memorial Speech Transcript","03:52"
"Donald Trump","When terrorists raised to destroy the seat of our democracy, the 40 of Flight 93 did the most American of things. They took a vote, and then they acted.

In this Pennsylvania field, the 40 intrepid souls of Flight 93 died as true heroes.

"Donald Trump","In the days and weeks after 9/11, citizens of all faiths, background, colors, and creeds, came together, prayed together, mourned together, and rebuilt together.

"Donald Trump","In New York, Arlington, and Shanksville people raced into the suffocating smoke and rubble. At ground zero, the world witnessed the miracle of American courage and sacrifice. As ash rained down, police officers, first responders, and firefighters ran into the fires of hell. On that day, more than 400 first responders gave their lives, including 23 New York City police officers, 37 port authority workers, and 343 New York City firefighters. Today, we honor their extraordinary sacrifice and every first responder who keeps America safe.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-2020-9-11-memorial-speech-transcript","Donald Trump 2020 9/11 Memorial Speech Transcript","06:28"
"Donald Trump","With us today is David D’Amato, a retired Chicago police officer and a current officer of the Navy reserves. On 9/11, he drove from Chicago to ground zero. As David says, “While the sights and smells of working at ground zero will forever be etched in my mind, what is more profound is the way this country came together afterwards. The police officers and firemen were revered as the heroes they truly are. The military was appreciated in a manner not seen in decades. Common people found new meaning in values like friendship, kindness, and selflessness.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-2020-9-11-memorial-speech-transcript","Donald Trump 2020 9/11 Memorial Speech Transcript","07:23"

"Donald Trump","This morning, we also remember the 183 people who were killed in the attack on the Pentagon and the remarkable service members who crawled straight through the raging blaze to rescue their comrades. We express our undying loyalty to the nearly 6 million young men and women who have enlisted in the United States Armed Forces since September 11th, 2001. More than 7,000 military heroes have laid down their lives since 9/11 to preserve our freedom. No words can express the summit of their glory or the infinite depth of our gratitude, but we will strive every single day to repay our immeasurable debt and prove worthy of their supreme sacrifice.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-2020-9-11-memorial-speech-transcript","Donald Trump 2020 9/11 Memorial Speech Transcript","08:23"
"Donald Trump","America will never relent in pursuing terrorists that threaten our people. Less than one year ago, American warriors took out the savage killer and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. Soon after, our warriors ended the brutal reign of the Iranian butcher who murdered thousands of American service members. The world’s top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, is dead.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-2020-9-11-memorial-speech-transcript","Donald Trump 2020 9/11 Memorial Speech Transcript","09:17"
"Donald Trump","Here in Shanksville, this community locked arms and hearts in the wake of tragedy. With us today is Chuck Wagner, a heavy equipment operator who lives just a few miles away. Very soon after the attack, Chuck helped search for the black box. He was so changed by what he experienced, that he joined with several members of his church to become what they call ambassadors for the 40 men and women on Flight 93. Chuck and his neighbors learned about each person, cared for their families, and each day, rain or shine, they took shifts standing vigil over their final resting place. Long before this place was a National Memorial, back when it was marked by a simple wooden cross, Chuck and his fellow ambassadors were always here waiting to tell visitors about those we lost.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-2020-9-11-memorial-speech-transcript","Donald Trump 2020 9/11 Memorial Speech Transcript","09:48"

"Donald Trump","Also, with us is Marine veteran Jason Thomas, from long Island. On September 11th, Jason had just retired from the Marines, but he immediately put back on his uniform and raced into the nightmare of ash and debris. At ground zero he found a fellow Marine, Dave Carnes. Together, they began to call out, “United States Marines. United States Marines. If you can hear us yell, tap, do whatever you can do. We’re the United States Marines.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-2020-9-11-memorial-speech-transcript","Donald Trump 2020 9/11 Memorial Speech Transcript","11:53"
"Donald Trump","Soon, they heard a shout for help. Two police officers were trapped beneath 20 feet of rubble. Jason and Dave dug for hours on end, knowing that at any moment the wreckage could come down on them, crushing them alive. At one point, someone told Jason to stop, Jason replied, “I’m a Marine. I don’t go back. I go forward.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-2020-9-11-memorial-speech-transcript","Donald Trump 2020 9/11 Memorial Speech Transcript","12:29"
"Donald Trump","That day, Jason helped save the lives of those two officers. For years Jason said nothing about what he did on 9/11. He did not even tell his five children, but when he saw the rescue recounted on TV, he decided to meet those officers. One of them gave him a gift, a steel cross made from a beam that Jason helped lift to free them from the hell on earth.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-2020-9-11-memorial-speech-transcript","Donald Trump 2020 9/11 Memorial Speech Transcript","12:53"
"Donald Trump","As Jason said about the cross, “It means a lot. It’s a symbol of what we are as Americans, because that day we all came together and stood as a nation, as Americans. It didn’t matter what race you were, what religion you were. It didn’t matter. We all came together to help one another. I’d die for this country. I’d die for this country.” Jason, thank you very much for bearing witness to the character of our nation. Jason. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you, Jason.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-2020-9-11-memorial-speech-transcript","Donald Trump 2020 9/11 Memorial Speech Transcript","13:23"
"Donald Trump","The men and women of Flight 93 were mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, husbands and wives.
