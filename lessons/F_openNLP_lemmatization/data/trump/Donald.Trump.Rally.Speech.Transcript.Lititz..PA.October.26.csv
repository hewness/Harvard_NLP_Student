"Donald Trump","Thank you. This is a big crowd. That’s a lot of people. That’s a lot of people let’s see here. Early in the day… That’s a lot of people. They’ve got themselves a big, big surprise coming, don’t they huh? It’s like four years ago, except now we’ve done it all so now you know. You know before I’d come in and say, “We’re going to do this. We’re going to give you tax cuts. We’re going to rebuild your military. We’re going to give you regulation cuts, the biggest in history.” But now we’ve done it all so now you know.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","00:11"
"Donald Trump","It’s not just talk. The others all talk, no action. This is not talk. We’ve done it. We’ve done so much. Hello, Pennsylvania. Eight days from now, we are going to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and we’re going to win four more great years in the White House. Our opponent Sleepy Joe Biden, you heard it the other night at the debate. Did anybody see the debate? That’s where he said that there will be no fracking, right? No energy. How about a million jobs from Pennsylvania? Forget about it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","02:20"
"Donald Trump","His agenda is one of doom and gloom and depression and despair. He’s right now locked in his basement. He’s put the lid on. You know the lid on the garbage can. That’s what they [inaudible 00:03:29]. Somebody said he’s going to make his way out. You know he sees we had a tremendous crowd before. We have another one of these and you know those … Well, I love you too. I don’t know who she is, but she sounds very nice. She sounds very nice. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","03:18"
"Donald Trump","No, no, he saw what went on two hours ago at another location in Pennsylvania and he said, “We better get out.” I don’t think he said it. His people said, his handlers they said, “Listen, Sleepy Joe, we got to get you out of the basement.” So they just announced, you know this morning they announced they’re putting the lid. You know the lid? And I hear it’s for five days, five days. That’s 50% of the campaign. Now but they just announced we had a tremendous, I mean just a lot of love, right? And they just announced he’s leaving to make his speech. You know where he’s going to make it? In Delaware. He always makes it in Delaware.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","04:00"
"Donald Trump","About three minutes from his basement. They got to get him out. That’s why. They got to get him out. They see what’s happening. You know our polls are through the roof and the fake news. Look at all those people there. They don’t like to report it. They don’t like to report it. Our agenda is one of unlimited optimism, opportunity, growth, patriotism, prosperity, and true American pride. That’s what we have. That’s what we have. You heard him the other night. “This is going to be a dark winter.” No, it’s not going to be a dark winter. It’s going to be a great winter. It’s got to to be a great spring.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","04:38"
"Donald Trump","For the last half century, Joe Biden’s been outsourcing your jobs right here in Pennsylvania. You were one of the biggest victims of it. Opening your borders and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars. They just never ended. Countries you’ve never even heard of. And we’re bringing them all back. Our boys and young women are coming all back. Now Biden is trying to ban fracking. You heard it the other night. Oh, it was so nice. He almost made it through the debate. I was a little surprised. Wasn’t great, but he was fine. And then we talk the energy question and he forgot. He forgot.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","05:22"
"Donald Trump","Now we want to wean ourselves off energy. Oh, that’s not so good. And I said, “Texas, are you listening?” Pennsylvania, are you listening? Now he’s going to ban fracking because he has no choice. His party wants to ban it. He’s going to ban fracking and deliver an economic death sentence for Pennsylvania and for many other places in our country. And frankly it affects not just places that frack and oil territory, you know who it affects? Everybody having to do with paying an energy bill. How about the $2 gasoline for your car? That’s not bad, right? Remember? Remember what it used to be? 5.50 and nobody saw an end in sight.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","06:09"
"Donald Trump","We have it to two and even sometimes below, at the same time we saved our great companies, our energy. We’re number one in the world now, by far number one in the world. And Pennsylvania is a big, big part of it. In last week’s debate, Joe Biden confirmed his plan to abolish the entire U.S. oil industry. I said, “Yu mean no more oil, Joe?” “Well, that’s what I mean.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","06:51"
"Donald Trump","I felt Like Perry, Mason. You ever watched Perry Mason? That last little. It was always the last minute. “I did it. I did it. Yes I did it. I was Perry Mason. No oil, Joe? She even said, “Why did you say that?” Right? Kristen, who was very good. Actually, I thought she was good. A lot of people thought she was tough. I thought she was very good. I thought she was good. I mean, considering that it was sort of supposed to be two on one from day one. Right? We’ve had that from the beginning, haven’t we huh? And here we are. Here we are.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","07:18"
"Donald Trump","No, I thought she was good. But she said that, right? She said, “Why did you say that? Why?” And that’s when he really got into trouble. That means no fracking, no natural gas, no jobs, no energy for Pennsylvania families. He will eradicate your energy and send Pennsylvania into a crippling depression. And that’s what you’ll have. If this guy gets in with the biggest tax cuts. Look, I gave you the biggest tax cuts in history. He wants to give you the biggest tax increase in history. Once they raise your taxes by the most ever … Think of this. All my life I’ve been watching politicians. “We will give you a tax cut. We will cut your taxes. We won’t cut them. We won’t cut them.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","07:56"
"Donald Trump","This guy is running against me. “We will raise your taxes.” Who the hell ever heard of that? I never heard of it. This could only happen to me. And then you have Biden’s running mate. How about her, Kamala? She’s considered America’s by far most liberal senator. She’s more liberal than Crazy Bernie, can you believe it? Even sponsored the $100 trillion Green New Deal, which will destroy our country. Totally destroy it. No planes, no cars. No cows, right? No cows. Cows are next. They took it out, but only temporarily they’ll do it. They don’t like cattle of any kind. And it’s a plan for economic suicide. 100 trillion. If our country did great every year for a hundred years, we’d lose a fortune at a 100 trillion. You couldn’t make that much no matter how well we did if everything was going on all 12 cylinders. 100 made up by AOC plus three, a great student of the environment. I don’t think she ever took an environmental course in college. She did go to college, right? AOC plus three, I heard she was very upset that I was calling her AOC plus three, three years her friends. Her three friends that know less than she knows.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","08:42"
"Donald Trump","Joe Biden is a diehard globalist who wiped out your steel mills, closed down your factories, killed your coal jobs, outsourced your industries. And supported every horrible, terrible, ridiculous trade deal for over a half a century. Think of it. 47 years plus. He was a cheerleader for NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever made and I ended it. Remember I used to say, “We’re going to end” and everyone smiled. They said, “Hey, look, give it a shot.” I got it done. Nobody thought I could get that done.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","10:08"
"Donald Trump","And USMCA just kicked in and it’s incredible for our country, less for their countries, but that’s okay. They’re happy sort of. Not too happy. He enthusiastically voted for China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. That was the beginning of the China rise. That was a disaster. They were flatlined for years and years and then boom. Thank you very much, Joe. I appreciate it, Joe. Joe and others decimating your manufacturing and enriching China at your expense. You know that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","10:46"
"Donald Trump","You know that China’s considered a third world country and for purposes of that it’s considered a developing country so they have all sorts of advantages over us in this horrible, horrible World Trade Organization. But we just won a seven in a half billion dollar lawsuit because they know I’ll pull so fast out of that mess. That is such an unfair deal. And all of a sudden we’re winning. All of a sudden we’re winning cases. Seven and a half billion. Seven and a half billion. They’re not happy about it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","11:17"
"Donald Trump","Now but think of it. They’re considered a developing nation. I said, “So we’re a developing nation too. We’re developing. They’re developing, we’re developing. They get big advantages.” Nobody ever says, Obama never said anything. Sleepy Joe never said that. I’m the one that figured it out. I said, “How come they’re getting all these great deals?” “Well, sir, they’re considered a developing nation. Whereas the United States is considered developed.” And I said, “We’re not developed. You got to be kidding me. We’re not developed.” We want to be a developing nation also.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","11:54"
"Donald Trump","And so having a big dispute, World Trade. Well, World Health, right? So we were paying 500 million a year. China was paying 39 million a year. China had more access and more power within the realm than we did. So I said, “Let me ask you a question.: Number one, they were wrong on almost everything. I don’t want to knock them, but they were wrong on the pandemic. They called a lot of shots wrong, almost everything. They were in China’s pocket. I said, “Just out of curiosity, let’s get down to dollars. Why are we, 325 million people, why are we paying 500 million and why is China paying 39 million? And China has more power within than we do.” So if you don’t mind, I withdrew from the World Trade from the World Health. From World Health. I withdrew from World Health.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","12:22"
"Donald Trump","And I promise you one thing, if we ever go back, we can go back from which less money. That I can tell you. You don’t pay 500. No, but seriously. So they have 1.5 billion people. They’re paying 39, right? We have 325. We’re paying 500. Other than that, it’s a wonderful transaction. I say, “Oh, we have hundreds.” I could talk to you all day about it. We have hundreds of things just like that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","13:21"
"Donald Trump","Pennsylvania lost 50% of its manufacturing jobs after Biden’s NAFTA and this China disaster that we signed. Decade after decade, vote after vote, Biden betrayed Pennsylvania. He betrayed our country through sheer stupidity. Even his Secretary of State who was also Secretary of Defense said, “He never made the right decision on foreign events, on foreign deals on foreign anything. He never made the right decision on economics. The guy doesn’t know what the hell he’s doing.” Do you finally understand this? He repeatedly tried to cut social security and Medicare. I think we have it. It costs a hell of a lot of money. We’re only doing this for very important groups.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","13:45"

I hope that’d being donated by the crane company for the good publicity they’re going to get. But that’s a lot of holding up the flags, but you know what? Our flag deserves a lot of power, doesn’t it? Now after years of economic treachery, Sleepy Joe Biden wants to ban fracking. And that’s what he is. We have the tapes. Remember he said, “Oh, play the tape.” This guy went for a full year. “We will ban fracking. We will ban fracking” like a hundred times. I could have this thing running for hours.

"Donald Trump","When it goes on. Cecil B. Demille. When it goes on, right? I’ll just show you a couple. But he went for a whole year, “We will ban fracking, ban fracking.” Then he got lucky. Elizabeth Warren decided that she wanted to hurt her person where the philosophies are the same. So she stayed in. Think of it. Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren. All she had to do is get out before Super Tuesday and Joe would not have won any state, right? Wouldn’t have won a state. She took the votes away from Crazy Bernie and you know Bernie is the best sportsman I’ve ever seen.

He’s a tremendous loser. He is a tremendous loser, but he did us some big favors. You know, we had a lot of Bernie’s people come with us last time because they agree with me on trade. They couldn’t have done what we did, but they know that we were being taken advantage of by foreign countries. Many of whom are allies. You know they keep saying, “We don’t treat our allies right.” Well, they don’t treat us right, either.

Okay? He’s going to destroy your economy. I mean, he said it and then he lies. He goes and says for a year, “There will be no fracking. And then he goes and he says, “There’ll be fracking” because he comes here, somebody explains that you have a million jobs in fracking. And he goes, “Oh, I didn’t know that.

No, he has 41 people, they’re 22 people and he gets up and then they say, “Oh, he’s so rhetorically good.” I never thought he was a good speaker personally. I really never did.

With your vote, we will continue to fight for American workers, nobody’s ever fought harder, lower drug prices. I instituted a favored nations laws. The drug companies do not like me. You’re going to have a 60, 70, 80% drop in drugs. Last year was the first year at 52 years, that drug prices went down.

They are spending more money on me right now than sleepy Joe and commercials, big pharma because we pay the highest prices in the world, and I said, “I want a favored nations,” where we matched … We match now the lowest country in the world.

That’s the way we have done. I told you that we will deliver a record prosperity, epic job growth and a safe vaccine that quickly ends the pandemic, which is ending with or without, and we have the vaccines.

We’ve done an incredible job with a lot of different things, but you’re going to have a GDP number, the Atlanta Fed said, now the highest I think was 8%, 9%. It was not … It was high.

So if you’d like to wait, everybody here is sure about Trump. But if you happen to be a little bit nervous, just wait. We’re going to have a 35% or a 25%, but it’s going to be magnificent because we are doing great. It’s the greatest comeback anywhere in the world economically, and we went down the least of any country in the world.

We’re cutting the middle income taxes, very substantially. We’re doing another cut and what it does, to be honest, it brings more business. It brings more jobs.

Now we have it down to two years to build a highway and it could be one, and it may be that you don’t build it because of environmental or safety, and that’s okay, but you’re going to know fast. You’re going to know fast and you will build it. But you’re going to know fast. 20 years, we have much worse than 20 years.

We’re getting it down to a number that’s … and by the way, it’s going to be much less expensive, much better. We have highways that started as a straight road from here to here that ended up like this, that caused a hundred times more, much more because it took so many years and we’re not doing that anymore. We’ll put it in. We’ll either get it approved or not get it approved. It’s a big impact. That’s one of the reasons that our foundations are so strong.

We can’t let it happen.

Sir, you’re going to win Pennsylvania.” He’s a political [inaudible 00:44:30].","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","43:52"
"Donald Trump","You know, when I got the first call from a great person, but I felt badly because we worked so hard. When I got the first call, I went in to see our great first lady who is a great person. I said, “First lady, first lady,” and I said, “First lady,” sometimes referred to as Melania, I said, “You know, it’s not looking good. It’s not looking good first lady. We worked hard.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","44:34"
"Donald Trump","It’s funny. I thought it wasn’t going to make it. But one thing, unlike Joe, where he goes into a basement, if he loses and who knows what happens, right? It’s called an election. He should be ashamed of himself because he didn’t work. No, seriously, he didn’t work. One thing, I did five, six, and sometimes seven of these in one day, those last few days. During the regular time I do two or three. Today, I’m doing three of these, a tremendous crowd waiting for us in another part. This is the second one.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","44:59"
"Donald Trump","So when they told me that information, you know, you feel badly, but I didn’t feel bad because I left it … You know, the athletes, they say, “We left it all in the field. It was all left.” I did six or seven that day, six or seven of these. This is not like talking in front of 10 people, right? There’s a lot of people here, and I did them from early in the morning till one o’clock in the morning, the next day, which is election day. So I didn’t feel …","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","45:34"
"Donald Trump","But then what happened, so I told the first lady, I said, “Not looking good.” She said, “Do you mean …”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","45:58"
"Donald Trump","… told the First Lady, I said, “Not looking good.” She said, “Do you mean we lost?” I said, “It looks like it.” Then I go in about an hour later, “First lady, I got news for you. I think we’re going to win.” Because they didn’t … Isn’t it sort of an amazing thing? But they didn’t say that they had this tremendous record set of numbers. When you leave, people usually say, “I voted for this one, that one, I voted.” But we had a record set of numbers, Jeffrey, we had a record set where they just said, “It’s none of your business. We don’t want to tell you.” And all of them were our votes. And this was the only guy that figured it out. So, we had one of the most exciting evenings in the history of this world, let alone this country. It was all over the world.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","46:03"
"Donald Trump","And we’re about to go into an evening, in eight days, can you believe that? We’re about to go into an evening, that I think is going to have a similar result and maybe even a bigger margin, but a similar result. And the same thing is happening. A good writer, very good writer, a writer on politics, but a lot of things, Byron York, right? Would you rate him good, right? I think he’s good. But I saw him this morning and he wrote something that they were asking him, who’s going to win? He said, “I don’t know.” Because they only show these fake polls. He said, “I don’t know, but I cover this,” he’s great political guy. And he said, “I go around and I cover this whole thing. And I’m not only talking about the rallies that Trump has, because he sets them up.” We have to take the space and we have to do. We’re organically, there are rallies of boats, thousands of boats, all over the place and cars and tractors and trucks. Trucks, thousands of them.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","46:44"
"Donald Trump","He said, “There’s never been anything like this.” He said, “I’ve never seen anything like this politically. There’s such a spirit, like I’ve never seen.” He said, “You have these organic and Trump has nothing to do with them. But they’re rallies where truckers get a thousand trucks.” In Iowa, they had like 2000 tractors on this massive field. He said, “I’ve never seen anything like this. So I can’t really tell you, but I have never seen.” And how about these rallies? Nobody’s ever had rallies like this. You might have a rally like this. You might have a rally like this on the night before the election, right? The night before the election, but you’d never have rallies. These are massive, every one, Ohio was so big. Ohio, if you would’ve added up inside and outside, you had at least 50,000 people, Wisconsin, the same kind of thing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","47:46"
"Donald Trump","But he said, “Forget those, I’m talking about where they just organically form, nothing to do with Trump.” And it’s an amazing thing, right? It’s an amazing thing. It’s an amazing … So, we have a spirit and enthusiasm, which is the most important thing. We have a spirit and enthusiasm, that’s even far greater than four years ago. We had a lot, we had a record, but have much more, because we’ve done so much. Nobody, no administration has done in the first three and a half years, what we’ve done. When you think, we’ve rebuilt our military, we’ve gotten the big tax cuts, we’ve gotten the biggest regulation cuts in history.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","48:34"
"Donald Trump","I mean, so many things, Right to Try. I’m just thinking, Right to Try, where you can now as a patient, you’re terminally ill. You couldn’t get anything, you’d have to travel all over the world. Most people didn’t have money. They’d go home and they’d die. Now, we have Right to Try, where you can get these advanced treatments that haven’t been fully approved. You’re terminally ill, very hard to get. They’ve been trying to do it for 40 years. What we’ve done for the vets, what we’ve done for the vets, 91% approval rate.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","49:14"
"Donald Trump","So, there’s more enthusiasm now by far, and we had, look, we were known as, that was the most enthusiastic anybody has ever seen a political campaign. The deplorables, remember Hillary? The deplorables. I heard that speech. She said a second word, irredeemable, right? She said, “The deplorables and the irredeemables.” I thought irredeemables was worse, but that one didn’t catch on. Little did she know, whoever wrote that speech? I want no part of them, because the next day, I am a deplorable. I’m a proud deplorable.” Right? It was the craziest thing, but there has never been a campaign like that. This one has much more enthusiasm. The differences before I was a guy who was successful, who was saying, “We’re going to do this and this and this.” But you’re listening and you say, “Okay, now we’ve done.” We have done, according to two of those people, by the way, that I see there, we have done more than we promised. Like Space Force, we did Space Force, I never talked about Space Force, right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","49:47"
"Donald Trump","Think of it. We have now Space Force, a sixth branch of the new … of the military. It’s been 75 years since that happened, the Air Force, right? Now, I realized when I was in office that we needed it, because I saw Russia and I saw China, in particular. And I saw them and I said, “Well, we need this.” And it’s very hard to get, and we got it. We did much more than we even talked about doing. But the main thing is, we did it, we got it done. And that’s why there’s even more enthusiasm now than there was four years ago. That’s a long speech. Let’s get back to the teleprompter. Should we get back to the teleprompter or just keep going? Isn’t it nice to have a president that doesn’t need a teleprompter?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","50:52"

And he’s reading the answers, reporter, “Sir, could you please ask what flavor of ice cream you like?” They never asked me a question like that. “What flavor do you have, sir?” “I have … ” He wasn’t actually sure, actually. “I have vanilla and chocolate.” I said, “They never asked me a question like that.” Even crazy 60 minutes, did you see it last night? She was so hostile to me and with him it was softball, but you know what he did? Yesterday he called me, he called me George yesterday. He didn’t remember my name, I’m insulted by it. I didn’t know, was I supposed to be happy or was I supposed to be sad? He called me George. And then, I hear the reporter sort of said, “No, no. No, it’s not George. Donald.” We can’t have this slip, our country is too important.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","51:44"
"Donald Trump","President Xi is a hundred percent charm. Putin, a hundred percent charm. Kim Jong-un, North Korea, a hundred percent charm. We can can’t have this. This is not a game we’re playing. If Biden and the Democrats socialists are elected, they will raise your taxes, bury your regulations. They will bury you in regulations. Dismantle your police departments, you see that. Dissolve our borders, wall is 400 miles long now, it’s almost complete. Almost complete. And it’s everything that border patrol wanted. We gave them their ultimate wishlist. We said, “Let me see what you want. How about concrete plank?” I like concrete plank, it’s cheap. They said, “No Sir, we have to see through it. We like steel because it’s stronger than concrete, but we’d like concrete also.” So, we have the bars and then we have concrete in the bars. “And then sir, we’d like rebar in the middle.” So we have rebar in the middle. No, it’s really incredible and it’s had a tremendous impact. It’s the safest border we’ve ever had now, which is very good timing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","52:46"
"Donald Trump","And Mexico is paying for the wall, by the way. For those of you … You don’t hear anything about the wall anymore? It used to be like, when they thought I couldn’t get it done, it was every day. “He is not going to be able to get it done.” Remember Pelosi was fighting us, like crazy. Saying, “Walls are obsolete. We don’t need walls. We need drones to watch the people pour into our country. We need a drone a thousand feet up, so that we can watch people pour right in.” No, we have drones too, and they work off the wall, okay? That’s a good combination. But they were just going wild. And then once I got the financing and the this and the that, and then I won court cases all over the place, we started doing 10 miles a day. So, we’re up to over 400 miles, we’ll be finished very soon. But you don’t hear about it anymore. They don’t talk about the wall anymore.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","53:54"
"Donald Trump","They want to confiscate your guns, terminate religious liberty and pack the Supreme Court with radical Justices, who will shred the Second Amendment. You better get out and vote and to defend our God-given freedoms, I nominated Amy Coney Barrett, right? She’s going to be great. She’s going to be great. She’s going to be there for a long time. She’s going to be there for a long time. And they vote on her today. Tonight, today. The Democrats would say, “That’s a terrible thing.” They’d do the same. First, it was not terrible. Justice Ginsburg said, “No, he’s the president for four years. If somebody comes up in the fourth year, what’s the difference?” She said that. Of course, she was referring to Clinton or Obama, I guess, right? She perhaps wouldn’t have said it if it was me, but she did say it. And that’s the way it is. And they would do the same. Can you imagine Schumer crying to Chuck saying, “You know, we think it’s highly unethical to appoint a Supreme Court Justice, radical left Supreme Court Justice, because it’s the fourth year. And we think, therefore, we won’t do it.” Can you imagine that? They would do it. The only difference is they do it faster than we did it.

"Donald Trump","Joe Biden has made a corrupt bargain in exchange for his party’s nomination. He is handed control of his party over to the socialist, Marxists and left wing extremists. And if Biden wins, the flag burning radicals on the streets will be running your government, just like in Portland. We want to go in … We stopped them in Minnesota, Minneapolis, we stopped them. Wasn’t that a beautiful sight? We should have been allowed to do it a lot sooner. In Seattle, we let them know we’re coming in and the following, like two hours later, they walked away. We were all set to go in, I was sort of unhappy that they left. They took over a big chunk of Seattle, remember that? But we let them after a while, because the state is supposed to ask us and they weren’t going to. But we told them, “I’m sorry. Where’s Hunter? Where is Hunter?” He’s making … he’s trying to make a deal with a foreign country to pay him 10 million. Where’s Hunter? Remember the tee-shirt, where’s Hunter? I was right. Thank you very much for that [inaudible 00:57:02]. This can only happen in Pennsylvania, right? I was here for school. So, they don’t talk about Hunter the news now, you know that, right? I give a lot of credit to the New York post to endorse me on their cover today, I’m not going to … But they don’t talk about Hunter, because they’re not allowed to, because we don’t really have freedom of the press. We don’t, okay. We don’t have it. They have totally taken this horrible scandal, the second biggest scandal in the history of our country. The first biggest was they spied on my campaign. That’s the biggest and they got caught, but the second is this and won’t even talk about it. They won’t talk about it. And the tech giants will shut everybody down and you don’t even hear. Here’s a guy, had no job, and now all of a sudden he’s making millions and millions of dollars a year and they don’t want to talk about it. And they know it’s wrong, but that’s called the opposite of freedom of the press.

No, I mean, they’re suppressing, you talk about suppression. They’re suppressing something I’ve never seen. Honestly, nobody has ever seen anything like this. Even I, I mean, I’m not a big fan, I think the press is incredible, I think it should be incredible. It’s got such potential to be incredible, it would be so good for our country. But even me, I never heard of anything like what’s going on, where you’re not even allowed to write. New York Times, I don’t know if they’ve ever written a story about it. Washington Post, they totally don’t write. Here’s a guy who stole tens of millions. He had no energy experience, zero. He knew less than this very young woman up here.

"Donald Trump","No, he had no experience whatsoever. He was dismissed very ceremonially. I mean, look, he was, well, whatever you want to call it, it was a very sad, it was a sad dismissal. So, he gets out of Kuwait, he gets out of the military, had no job, nothing. And his father becomes vice-president, and he gets a job on Burisma. Burisma, right? And it’s a very, it’s got a questionable reputation place. It’s an energy company, gets $183,000 a month, plus they say $3 million upfront to be on the board of a company. Nobody gets that. So, he’s on the board of Burisma, He then goes and he gets three and a half, think of this, three and a half million dollars from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. He gets three and a half million, then he goes to China. He’s he’s like a human vacuum cleaner. He follows his father.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","59:23"
"Donald Trump","Then he goes to China, gets a billion and a half to manage, even though he’s never heard of managing money, he knows nothing about it. And it gets millions of dollars in fees. And then, he goes for the big quinella, but that’s where it sort of ended. He asked China to pay him $10 million a year because he wants to do introductions. It was an introductory fee, 10 million a year. And I think that’s probably at someplace where they got caught. But this is pure corruption and Joe got a piece of it, because they said 10% goes to the big guy. Now, unless they have another big guy. He’s not a big guy to me, he doesn’t look too big. He looks like a big guy. No, he doesn’t look like a big guy, but 10% goes to the big guy. He had another one, worth 50%. And they consider that off limits, you can’t talk. Can you imagine if that were me or my kids? I mean, it would be the biggest scandal. It’s a disgrace. And what they do is they shut it down. They will not write anything about it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","01:00:27"
"Donald Trump","I never thought a thing like that could happen. I never thought it could happen. In a way, it’s a bigger story than the corruption of Biden itself. Joe Biden took five days off before the debate because he wanted to practice and he’s still lost, like by a lot. You don’t want a president who takes five days off to study for a debate. I mean, you do it every day, what are you supposed to study for? Really, when you think about it. And now, he’s taking at least another four or five days off. But no, but I did hear the breaking news today was he’s going to make the speeches. I told you, I want to go hear, it’s so exciting. So exciting. When you’re a president, you can’t take a day off, you got to work. You got to work.

You can forget the frackers out there, enjoy your life, but it won’t be in the life of fracking. That’s all over the country, not just in Pennsylvania, because it will be run by the radical left and the green new deal, which I thought at first was a hoax. I thought it was like the Russia hoax. Okay. I thought it was a hoax. And it wasn’t, I don’t think they believe it, it’s so crazy. A hundred trillion dollars.

It’s like they raise all this money, $300 million, and they’re saying, “Oh, Trump is being outraced.” I would be the greatest fundraiser, all I have to do is call all the Wall Street guys, call all the guys, call everybody. I would get five, 10, 15, 20, 25 million, every time I made a phone call, but you know what? I could never basically deal with those companies properly again. So I don’t do it. And we don’t need the money, we got a lot of money for this stuff. We got another eight days to go. They had like $200 million, a lot of it’s small money, $61 average, small money.

I could do it much easier, because I’m much better at it, if I wanted to be. And think of it, I’m the President of the United States, calling the head of Goldman Sachs, “Goldman Sachs!” They said, “Who?” I know, I know them all. “I want you to give me $25 million, I’m running the campaign, please give me 25 million.” They never report this stuff. And they would say, “Where do we send the check? We can have it there in one hour, sir.” But I don’t want to do that because I’m compromised. Once you do that, you’re compromised.

He wants to send your jobs to China, while his family rakes in millions of dollars from the Chinese communist party, that’s what it is. I gave up a fortune to run for president, which is true. I lost a fortune on this deal. This is … I lost, I mean like billions, between what I lose and what I didn’t make, I lost a hell of a lot of money. And you know what?

I really, I ran for trade, I hated the trade deals. I saw that years ago in Michigan, they gave me the man of the year award. I said, “Why are you allowing them to take all of your car companies and moving them to Mexico and Canada? 32% of our companies were taken out.

Great job you’re doing and I appreciate it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","01:09:02"
"Donald Trump","No, it’s true. He said, “No, sir. We’re here for…” And I felt so safe after these guys, tough guys, definitely tough. And they’re sitting on those Harleys mostly, I guess, right? They’re [inaudible 01:09:45]. They felt good. That was never my deal, okay? I like the limousine better, I don’t know why. But you know, they’re going boom, boom and I never felt safer. It’s true. There was just a tremendous love that we had right from the beginning, right? Four years ago, right from the beginning. And it stayed that way, too. We’re with them all the way. We built the greatest economy in history and now we’re doing it again. We increased middle-class family income over $6,000, more than five times the gains in all eight years under the previous administration. African-American unemployment, Hispanic-American unemployment, Asian-American unemployment, unemployment for young people that didn’t have a high school education. They didn’t have a diploma. They had a diploma. They had a diploma from MIT where they were first in their class. It didn’t make any difference. Women did so great. Women, women, women did great.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","01:09:36"
"Donald Trump","They all reached the lowest levels ever recorded. Since April, we created a record 11.4 million jobs. And under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in U.S. history. That’s beautiful. Walls help. Walls work, don’t they? Remember? They said the wall is obsolete. I said no, a wall’s not obsolete and a wheel is obsolete. Everything else is obsolete. My opponent’s insane immigration plan would eliminate U.S. borders by implementing nationwide catch and release. And I actually heard he said, “We want to take down the wall.” Do you believe this? Take down the wall. We will never let that happen. We got to win this election. This is the most important… We got to win this election. Now they want to take down the wall. His plan, I don’t think… You know what, I don’t think Border Patrol would let them. Okay? You want to know the truth? I think Border Patrol would say, “Mr. President, we’re not letting you get anywhere near this wall, Mr. President.” His plan would also make every community into a sanctuary city for violent criminals. The Biden/Harris… How do you like Harris?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","01:10:51"
"Donald Trump","The Biden/Harris plan would also increase refugees 700%. This was the manifesto that was agreed to with crazy Bernie and Biden. Biden and crazy Bernie agreed to the… We call it the manifesto. 700% increase, the most dangerous places in the world they would come in, 700%. I have a ban, I was criticized for the ban. I said, “No. If a country hates us, and if their people hate us, and if they want to do bad things to us, we’re going to have a ban.” Everybody criticized me, but I won and the United States will benefit. And now we don’t let them in. If it’s okay by the great people of Pennsylvania, we don’t let them into our country. We want people that will love us and work with us and be a great help to us. That’s what we want. We have a ban. It was very controversial when I put it in, but it’s not so controversial. All you have to do is look what happened the other day in Paris and you’ll see that it’s not so controversial anymore.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","01:12:06"
"Donald Trump","People are very happy that we have it. And we keep a lot of very bad people out of our country and nobody else would do that. Nobody else would do that, Chris, I guarantee you that. Nobody else would do it. They pledged to terminate all national security travel bans. They want to end the ban, opening the floodgates to radical Islamic terrorism. No thank you. I’m keeping the terrorists, jihadists, and violent extremists, those terrible extremists, the hell out of our country, if that’s okay. We invested $2.5 trillion in the U.S. military. By the way, all made in the USA. We have the greatest equipment, the greatest missiles. We have the greatest rockets. We have the greatest jet fighter planes F-35. We have the greatest equipment anywhere in the world. Our nuclear arsenal is totally rebuilt or new. Hope to God we never have to use any of this equipment. Just hope we never have to… By having it, it’s less likely we’ll have to use it. That’s the way it is.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","01:13:10"
"Donald Trump","That’s the way it is. But we have the greatest. When I came in, a highly overrated general, one of the most highly overrated generals there are said, “Sir, we don’t have any ammunition.” Because we could have had a conflict, as you remember at the beginning. He said, “Sir, we don’t have any ammunition.” I said, “No president should ever hear that again.” And now we have so much ammunition. You won’t believe how much ammunition. He also passed VA Choice and VA Accountability. Everyone said impossible to get it done. And exactly one year ago today, we killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. And we took out the world’s top terrorist. Soleimani is dead. Soleimani is dead. Killed a lot of people, Soleimani. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal, $150 billion, $1.8 billion in cash. How about that? That’s a lot of cash. $1.8 billion, nobody’s ever even heard of such a thing. $1.8 billion, five planeloads of cash. I recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","01:14:14"
"Donald Trump","Every president for decades, they campaigned on that. Every president… Look at that, that’s [inaudible 00:06:43]. Every president for decades campaigned, they said, “Not so easy to do.” But I did it and I got the building built, right? Fast. We got it built for a tiny, tiny little fraction of what it was supposed to cost. Instead of never-ending wars, we are forging peace in the Middle East. You saw what just happened. You saw what just happened, right? Sudan yesterday, Sudan, UAE, United Arab Emirates, right? Bahrain. And we have them stacked up, stacked up. They want to come in and we did it the exact reverse as they’ve been trying to do for 40 years. I said, “That one doesn’t work.” And it’s all working out very well and there’s no blood in the sand and they want to come in. A vote for Republicans is a vote for the American Dream. It’s very simple. It is a vote for the American Dream. The Republican party is the party of Abraham Lincoln, right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","01:15:35"
"Donald Trump","I always say, when they start saying this or that, I say, “No, no. It’s very easy to be presidential.” I can be more presidential than any president in history with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln when he’s wearing the hat, right? Actually, doing this is much tougher than being presidential, doing what I do is much tougher. And if I was presidential, perfectly presidential, there’d be about three people like Obama had the other day, three people. And in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China, which is already beginning. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will hold up our Second Amendment. Second Amendment. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. The biggest thing is price transparency. You will see, it goes into effect, already signed. I’ve signed it January 1st.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","01:16:44"
"Donald Trump","The biggest thing, lower drug prices. As I told you, favored nations clauses, biggest decrease in the history. Wait till you see that when that kicks in. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions, always. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag, always. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto In God We Trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Pennsylvania. I’m standing up. For the last four years, you’ve seen me fight for you and now I am relying on you to deliver a historic victory for our country, bigger even than four years ago. Got to vote. By the way, could I ask you… Pennsylvania’s known as a very late-voting state, which is good, which is fine. Very late voting like, Election Day.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","01:18:06"
"Donald Trump","Very unusual actually, but I understand it. You want to make sure your vote is counted. You don’t want the ballot hoax. Because when you see it, they’ll have so many problems. You know, they throw away ballots if it has the name Trump on it, boom. They printed ballot, some ballots, I think 25,000, were printed for certain states. It was missing one little thing, the name Trump, so a lot of bad things happened. But Pennsylvania’s smart, you vote late. Who has voted? Raise your hand. Yeah, that’s what happens. This is going to be a red wave. Who is going to vote? This is going to be… And I’m glad you saw the last debate. Did you hear the number one thing on Google was how do I change my vote? Did you know that? How do I change my vote? Something like hashtag, did you hear that, hashtag, how do I change my vote? They watched the debate. Remember? I wanted that debate to move way up because a lot of people voted by this crazy ballot deal. Wait till you see the mess that thing’s going to be in.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","01:19:45"
"Donald Trump","Well, even your state, they can count them after the election is over. This is major state. They want to count them. They don’t want poll watchers and they want to be able to count votes after the election is over. What does that mean? We’re going to wait? The whole country is going to wait? We’ll see how it all ends up. It’s all in court. It’s all a hoax. And let me tell you something, the Democrats know how crooked it is, they know. And then they talk about, he’s not for freedom. He’s not for freedom. Our president is not for freedom and he’s not looking for an easy transition and safe… What about the transition that I had, where you spied on my campaign and you tried to take down the President of the United States? That didn’t work out too well. But they want a friendly transition, right Jeffrey? A friendly… But the only problem is, look at the transition they gave us. They fought us tooth and nail for years. Russia, Russia, Russia, $48 million spent on Mueller, that whole hoax, $48 million. No collusion, right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","01:20:48"
"Donald Trump","No collusion. $48 million. Now they want a friendly, friendly… First of all, here’s the main thing, let’s not lose and then we don’t have to worry about it. Let’s just win. We won’t lose, so there’s nothing to talk about. Let’s leave it that way. No, we want everything to be done properly and we want it to be done absolutely by the book. And we want to go absolutely by our great Constitution. But you know what? When they start talking about this friendly, wonderful transition, and then you see what they put us through, it’s really very hypocritical, isn’t it? On November 3rd, we must finish the job and drain that very deep and very nasty swamp once and for all. Get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, and get your coworkers, even get your boss. Say, “Boss, I want to get you out to vote.” But get out and vote, most important election ever. I really believe that. I never thought I’d say it. If you would’ve told me I was going to say that two years ago, three years ago, four years ago, I would have not believed it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","01:21:53"
"Donald Trump","From Erie to Eastern, from Pittsburgh to Harrisburg, and from Lebanon to right here in Lancaster. We stand on the shoulders of Pennsylvania patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. This is the state where Founding Fathers declared American independence. Think of it, what you did. Think of Pennsylvania. Think of it relative to our country. So much has happened, so many important events. It’s where the army weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge, where General George Washington… Don’t worry, we will not be taking down the Washington Monument, [inaudible 00:14:52]. Cancel culture. Congressman, there’ll be no cancel culture. Now can you believe that? They actually had a commission, the D.C. mayor. One of the recommendations is, Lincoln, Jefferson, Washington Memorials, let’s take them out. And they didn’t like Mount Rushmore either, okay? It’s blowing right up now. Not going to happen. No, we stopped it. You know, I signed a document. You play with any of our statues or monuments, 10 years in prison.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","01:23:05"
"Donald Trump","It’s amazing how that stopped. All of a sudden Jeffrey, it just stopped, right? You don’t see it anymore. Where General George Washington led his men on a daring mission across the Delaware and when our union was saved by the great heroes of Gettysburg. Gettysburg, think of it, Gettysburg. What a place. Never fight uphill, boys. Right? That was Robert E. Lee, he said, “Never fight uphill.” He heard they were fighting uphill, but they didn’t have cell phones in those days. They tried to get them to stop, but they fought uphill, that didn’t work out. Think of that though, Gettysburg, the history. This is the place where generations of tough, strong, Pennsylvania workers mind the call, work the railroads, forge the steel that made America into the greatest, most powerful nation in the history of the world and where we are making it far greater than it ever was. We are making it far greater. This nation will be greater than it ever was. And I so believe that. I so believe that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lititz-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lititz, PA October 26","01:24:34"

And they don’t like that in Washington. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of Pennsylvania, we have made America powerful again, our military. We have made America wealthy again, your sock rockets, your 401ks. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Pennsylvania. Thank you.
