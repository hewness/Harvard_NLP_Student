"Chris Wallace","And hello again from Fox News in Washington today from the White House. We’re on the president’s patio, just outside the oval office.

"Chris Wallace","Let’s start with the surge of the coronavirus across the country in recent months. You still talk about it as, “Burning embers,” but I want to put up a chart that shows where we are with the illness over the last four months. As you can see, we hit a peak here in April, 36,000 cases-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-chris-wallace-interview-transcript-july-19","Donald Trump Chris Wallace Interview Transcript July 19","00:17"

"Donald Trump","Chris, that’s because we have great testing, because we have the best testing in the world. If we didn’t test, you wouldn’t be able to show that chart. If we tested half as much, those numbers would be down. We tested-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-chris-wallace-interview-transcript-july-19","Donald Trump Chris Wallace Interview Transcript July 19","00:49"

"Donald Trump","No, no. But I don’t say… I say flames. We’ll put out the flames and we’ll put out, in some cases, just burning embers. We also have burning embers. We have embers and we do have flames. Florida became more flame-like, but it’s going to be under control. And it’s not just this country. It’s many countries. We don’t talk about it in the news. They don’t talk about Mexico and Brazil and still parts of Europe, which actually got hit sooner than us, so it’s a little ahead of us in that sense. But you take a look, why don’t they talk about Mexico, which is not helping us? And all I can say is thank God I built most of the wall because if I didn’t have the wall up we would have a much bigger problem with Mexico.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-chris-wallace-interview-transcript-july-19","Donald Trump Chris Wallace Interview Transcript July 19","01:01"

"Donald Trump","Yeah, I think what we’ll do… Well, we have them on a travel ban, too, Chris. I closed them off. If you remember, I was the one that did the European Union very early. But when you talk about mortality rates, I think it’s the opposite. I think we have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-chris-wallace-interview-transcript-july-19","Donald Trump Chris Wallace Interview Transcript July 19","01:50"

"Speaker 2","All right, it’s a little complicated, but bear with us. We went with numbers from Johns Hopkins University, which charted the mortality rate for 20 countries hit by the virus. The US ranked seventh, better than the United Kingdom, but worse than Brazil and Russia. The White House went with this chart from the European CDC, which shows Italy and Spain doing worse, but countries like Brazil and South Korea doing better. Other countries doing better, like Russia, aren’t included in the White House chart.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-chris-wallace-interview-transcript-july-19","Donald Trump Chris Wallace Interview Transcript July 19","02:42"
"Chris Wallace","California locking down again. Florida, deadliest day of the entire pandemic. Hospitals at capacity a number of places around the country, shortages of testing, shortages of personal protective equipment for nurses and doctors. A lot of people say this is because we don’t have a national plan. You talk about states, we don’t have a national plan. Do you take responsibility for that?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-chris-wallace-interview-transcript-july-19","Donald Trump Chris Wallace Interview Transcript July 19","03:11"
"Donald Trump","Look, I take responsibility always for everything because it’s ultimately my job to. I have to get everybody in line. Some governors have done well, some governors have done poorly. They’re supposed to have supplies they didn’t have, I supplied everybody. Now we have somewhat of a surge in certain areas and other areas we’re doing great, but we have a surge in certain areas. But you don’t hear people complaining about ventilators. We’ve got all the ventilators we can use. We’re supplying them to other countries. We go out into parking lots and everything, everybody gets a test. We find if we did half the testing, with all of that being said, I’m glad we did it. This is the right way to do it. I’m glad we did what we’re doing, but we have more tests by far than any country in the world.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-chris-wallace-interview-transcript-july-19","Donald Trump Chris Wallace Interview Transcript July 19","03:35"
"Chris Wallace","But sir, testing is up 37%.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-chris-wallace-interview-transcript-july-19","Donald Trump Chris Wallace Interview Transcript July 19","04:20"
"Donald Trump","Well, that’s good.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-chris-wallace-interview-transcript-july-19","Donald Trump Chris Wallace Interview Transcript July 19","04:24"
"Chris Wallace","I understand. Cases are up 194%. It isn’t just that testing has gone up, it’s that the virus has spread. The positivity rate has increased. The virus is worse than it was.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-chris-wallace-interview-transcript-july-19","Donald Trump Chris Wallace Interview Transcript July 19","04:25"
"Donald Trump","Many of those cases are young people that would heal in today. They have the sniffles and we put it down as a test. Many of them. Don’t forget, I guess it’s like 99.7%. People are going to get better. And in many cases, they’re going to get better very quickly. We go out and we look, and then on the news, look, if you go back to the news, even your wonderful competitors, you’ll see cases are up. Cases are up. Many of those cases shouldn’t even be cases. Cases are up because we have the best testing in the world, and we have the most testing. No country has ever done what we’ve done in terms of testing. We are the envy of the world. They call and they say the most incredible job anybody’s done is our job on testing, because we’re going to very shortly be up to 50 million tests. You look at other countries, they don’t even do tests. They do tests if somebody walks into the hospital, they’re sick, they’re really sick, they test them then, or they’ll test them in a doctor’s office. But they don’t go around and have massive areas of testing, and we do. And I’m glad we do, but it really skews the numbers.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-chris-wallace-interview-transcript-july-19","Donald Trump Chris Wallace Interview Transcript July 19","04:37"
"Chris Wallace","I’m going to do you a favor, because I’m sure a lot of people listening right now are going to say, “Trump, he tries to play it down, he tries to make it not seem as serious as it is.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-chris-wallace-interview-transcript-july-19","Donald Trump Chris Wallace Interview Transcript July 19","05:41"

"Donald Trump","Excuse me. It’s all too much. It shouldn’t be one case. It came from China, they should have never let it escape, they should have never let it out. But it is what it is.

"Donald Trump","No, it’s possible that they don’t test. That’s what’s possible. We find cases, and many of those cases heal automatically. We’re finding in a way we’re creating trouble. Certainly we’re creating trouble for the fake news to come along and say, “Oh, we have more cases.” Look, we did something that nobody’s ever done. Not only the ventilators where we’re supplying them all over the world. We did a testing program, the likes of which nobody’s ever done before.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-chris-wallace-interview-transcript-july-19","Donald Trump Chris Wallace Interview Transcript July 19","06:22"

"Donald Trump","I don’t know and I don’t think he knows. I don’t think anybody knows with this. This is a very tricky deal. Everybody thought the summer it would go away and it would come back in the fall. Well, in the summer it came, they used to say the heat was good for it and it really knocks it out. Remember? And then it might come back in the fall. So they got that one wrong. They got a lot wrong. They got a lot wrong, the World Health got a tremendous amount wrong. They basically did whatever China wanted them to. And we’ll save now almost $500 million a year, which is nice. But the World Health got a lot wrong.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-chris-wallace-interview-transcript-july-19","Donald Trump Chris Wallace Interview Transcript July 19","07:02"

Why on earth would your administration be involved in a campaign at this point to discredit Dr. Fauci, who is the nation’s top infectious disease expert?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-chris-wallace-interview-transcript-july-19","Donald Trump Chris Wallace Interview Transcript July 19","07:46"
"Donald Trump","Because we’re not. If one man from my administration doesn’t like him because he made a few mistakes… Look, Dr. Fauci said don’t wear a mask. Dr. Fauci told me not to ban China, it would be a big mistake. I did it over and above his recommendation. Dr. Fauci then said, “You saved tens of thousands of lives more than that.” He said, “You saved tens of thousands of lives.” Dr. Fauci’s made some mistakes, but I have a very good… I spoke to him yesterday at length.

You wore a mask for the first time in public at Walter Reed this weekend. Question, the CDC says, “If everybody wore a mask for four to six weeks, we could get this under control.” Do you regret not wearing a mask in public from the start, and will you consider a national mandate that people need to wear masks?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-chris-wallace-interview-transcript-july-19","Donald Trump Chris Wallace Interview Transcript July 19","09:54"

Hey, Dr. Fauci said don’t wear a mask. Our surgeon general, terrific guy, said don’t wear a mask. Everybody was saying don’t wear a mask. All of a sudden everybody’s got to wear a mask. And as you know, masks cause problems, too. With that being said, I’m a believer in masks. I think masks are good. But I leave it up to the governors. Many of the governors are changing, they’re more mask into, they like the concept of masks. But some of them don’t agree.

The Supreme Court gave the President of the United States powers that nobody thought the president had, by approving, by doing what they did, their decision on DACA. And DACA is going to be taken care of also. But we’re getting rid of it because we’re going to replace it with something much better. But we got rid of already, which was most of Obamacare, the individual mandate. And that I’ve already won on. And we won also on the Supreme Court. But the decision by the Supreme Court on DACA allows me to do things on immigration, on healthcare, on other things that we’ve never done before.

"Donald Trump","I agree. Those people know I’m doing a good job, but there’s something in my personality that they don’t like, because look, nobody’s done what I’ve done. Biden wants to come in and ruin our country, triple your taxes. He wants to do things. He wants to add regulations that I’ve all cut, and we still have regulation, a lot of regulation, but I’ve cut it down to a level that nobody ever thought possible. He will destroy this country, but it won’t be him. It will be the radical left, the same type ideology that took over Venezuela, one of the richest countries in the world. They now have no water. They have no food, and they have no medicine. That’s going to happen here if he wins.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-chris-wallace-interview-transcript-july-19","Donald Trump Chris Wallace Interview Transcript July 19","36:32"

Are you saying you’re not prepared now to commit to that principle?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-chris-wallace-interview-transcript-july-19","Donald Trump Chris Wallace Interview Transcript July 19","37:40"

"Donald Trump","No, no. I want to go this. I have done more than any president in history in the first three and a half years, and I’ve done it suffering through investigations where people have been, General Flynn, where people have been so unfairly treated. The Russia hoax, it was all a hoax. The Mueller scam, it was all a scam. It was all false. I made a bad decision on one bad decision, Jeff Sessions, and now I feel good, because he lost overwhelmingly in the great state of Alabama. Here’s the bottom line. I’ve been very unfairly treated, and I don’t say that as paranoid. I’ve been very … Everybody says it. It’s going to be interesting to see what happens, but there’s tremendous evidence right now as to how unfairly treated I was.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-chris-wallace-interview-transcript-july-19","Donald Trump Chris Wallace Interview Transcript July 19","38:44"

It would’ve started two years ago, and they’d be there for 50 years. The fact is, they illegally spied on my campaign. Let’s see what happens.
