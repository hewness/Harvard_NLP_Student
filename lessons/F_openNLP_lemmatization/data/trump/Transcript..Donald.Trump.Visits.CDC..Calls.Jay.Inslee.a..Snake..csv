"Steve Monroe","The novel coronavirus and the Chinese to their credit made that sequence information available right away. Ours coronavirus experts here at CDC used that sequence information to design a test so that we would be able to detect the virus, even though at that time there were no cases in the US and we had no samples of the virus because we had no clinical material.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","00:29"
"Steve Monroe","And so we quickly went from designing the test and the materials were made in these laboratories. The quality control is done here, and then our scientists use that to validate that it would work against what they could make as the coronavirus using just the sequence information, but importantly so that it would not detect other things because we want a positive to only be for the coronavirus, not for other kinds of viruses that create similar respiratory samples.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","00:51"

"Steve Monroe","And then in relatively short order, as the information coming out of China indicated that this was more serious than was originally thought, originally seven cases, we stood up our incident management system here at CDC so that we would have all the right components together; the epidemiology, the laboratory, the communications, the policy funds, and then once it became clear that it was even more serious, that’s when we started to work with our colleagues at FDA to say, we need to make this test available to the larger public health laboratory community, and so worked with FDA to then-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","01:25"

"Steve Monroe","To get what we call emergency use authorization so that we could distribute the test to our, originally to our public health laboratory counterparts. And now working with the commercial manufacturers, we’re in position to scale up that production beyond what we can do with our own facility here so that there’s the capacity to test more and more Americans and we are as we work today, to qualify more of those materials to go out.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","02:02"
"Steve Monroe","And it’s important to note that at no time during this response has CDC ever denied a request that came from a public health official, either state or local, to test a patient. So all the patients who needed to be tested, in the opinion of the public health officials, have been tested.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","02:32"

"Robert Redfield","Well, I think I first I want to thank you for your decisive leadership in helping us put public health first.

"Alex Azar","Up to four million tests available to the United States by the end of next week. We’ve got commercial labs are getting validated as we speak. By the end of this weekend, we’ll, as promised, have enough testing that CDC has produced for to test 75000 people is already out and then enough tests for another million tests to be done and that’s … Most of that is shipped. The last lots are here being validated by Dr. Monroe’s team as we speak.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","03:41"
"Robert Redfield","The one thing I would like to add, the purpose of all of this as Dr. Monroe said, is to have the capacity to detect the unknown. These labs developed tests for Zika, SARS, MERS, and now this coronavirus. And I think it really is remarkable the capacity we had here. Once we got the sequence, I think this lab team had a functional test in about seven days that they then worked with the FDA to make sure it was regulated. I think it’s … That’s really what we do.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","04:09"
"Donald Trump","And they started working when they saw there was a problem in China, that was many weeks ago. So they saw there was something going on in China long before anybody even heard of it. That was actually before it was even in the print. They heard there was a problem in China. That’s when they started working on this and that’s pretty incredible. That’s why we’re in good shape.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","04:38"

"Robert Redfield","Yeah. I think at this point again, and we’ve said this before, the secretary can add, the overall risk to the American public does remain low. And again I think we owe a lot to the decisive decisions initially to have travel restrictions and a number of areas of screening in airports. And then the most important is to get the public health community to do the early case recognition, isolation and contact [inaudible 00:05:28], which again, the fact that we now had a test, allowed us to do that a lot more effectively if we didn’t have a test.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","05:04"
"Robert Redfield","We do have some areas where there’s significant community transmission now. Obviously we’ve seen that in the Seattle area and we’ve seen it in parts of California. We’re working hard with the local state health departments and those groups to continue to try to control this infection in that area. I think as the president said, or maybe the secretary, we still have only around 200 cases that we’ve diagnosed in the United States. We’re going to see more cases because we’re getting more diagnostics out there. But I would say that again, what I said before that at the present time, the general risk to the American public remains low.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","05:35"
"Robert Redfield","We’re going to concentrate and help those communities though that are now fighting the battle. Like in the state of Washington, some of you were there I think the other day when we were out there so.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","06:12"
"Reporters","I have a question for Dr. Monroe please. Would you admit that the CDC did have problems with the testing? You say that there were people who, that these health officials never had to request [inaudible 00:06:32] the test but you set such strict guidelines so people were coming in and saying they couldn’t get the test. And we talked to dozens of people that have contacted us saying they couldn’t get the test even though they had the symptoms because they didn’t meet your criteria because your tests were faulty.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","06:21"
"Steve Monroe","So we did learn shortly after redistributed the first batch of our tests to the some of the state health labs that there was an issue with one component of the test. And so we quickly put together a team to try to figure out what that issue was and we suggested that people not test until we could sort that out. But what we have are three different signatures that we test for. And we, in working with FDA colleagues, we identified that two of those were sufficient to have a positive conclusive test. And so we’ve moved forward now with testing with just the two signatures.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","06:46"
"Steve Monroe","This is something that could easily happen where we’re just against starting from scratch with sequence information, building a test rather rapidly. We did small scale testing here before rolling it out because our goal was to get it out to the public health labs as quickly as possible.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","07:21"
"Reporters","But you didn’t have to start from scratch. You could have just used the WHO’s test.

"Steve Monroe","But we started with our tests probably at the same time the Germans and the other Italians and the other groups that have worked with WHO were developing their tests. Nobody could start with test development until the sequence information was made available by the Chinese.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","07:43"

"Robert Redfield","I’d like to make one thing clear.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","08:00"
"Reporters","Please.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","08:01"
"Robert Redfield","When this test was developed in really very rapid time, it was first offered here at CDC. So all the public health labs of this nation could use CDC as we do when any new disease comes and we can help them understand if this new pathogen is in that individual. That was available as soon as our test was approved by the FDA. Not a faulty test, a very accurate test, but the challenge was you had to send the sample here to CDC. That’s the same test we use today. So no state lab never had no access. They always have the ability to send it here.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","08:02"

"Robert Redfield","No, they had to send it here because that’s how we started it. Then we developed the test to expand and in the manufacturing there was … And after that, we shipped it out to the states to see if they could verify did it work. We found that in some of the States that didn’t work, we figured out why. I don’t consider that a fault. I consider that doing quality control. I consider that success, making sure this test was going to perform out there with the same proficiency that it performed here.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","08:43"

"Donald Trump","They’re fantastic people. These are fantastic people. Now it’s performing very well and it has been performing very well. And as you said, you had two of the three that worked perfectly and that’s all you need is two of the group. In fact, you could have one of the three and it would work. So we had two of the three but now it’s performing perfectly in all cases.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","09:18"

"Alex Azar","Dr. Monroe, could you explain on the testing criteria how that compares? You’ve explained to the president, how they compared to China and international standards.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","09:36"
"Steve Monroe","Right. So early on it and when we submit our tests to the FDA for emergency use authorization, we have to specify what are the conditions under which a person should be tested. And certainly at the beginning, we wanted it to be clear that all of the cases at that time were associated with travel to one of the endemic areas or other things like that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","09:45"
"Steve Monroe","And so the criteria in the package insert were strict about who could be tested because we didn’t want just a lot of people with compatible symptoms who had no history of exposure to be tested. But as was stated, there was never a time when a public health official contacted CDC to ask testing and it was not a done, even if they didn’t quite meet the strict definition [crosstalk 00:10:34].","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","10:07"
"Alex Azar","I understand even China had a geographic travel restriction on who they tested and they were the epicenter. Is that right Dr. Monroe?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","10:34"
"Steve Monroe","Right. At the very beginning, they were only testing people who had a direct contact at the seafood market in Wuhan.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","10:43"
"Speaker 3","Is there a chance that the limited testing means that the numbers are low and the public has been misled about how widespread this is?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","10:48"
"Robert Redfield","Yeah. We have been diagnosing cases here from the beginning originally linked to travel, associated with very aggressive public health measures of contact tracing. So you might find one confirmed case and you might evaluate another 300 people all right? And as we went out to do that, the only contacts initially from the beginning that we found were two spouses of spouses who came back from Wuhan and all the other contacts were negative. Over time, when the state of Washington sent a sample from an individual, they made the first diagnosis. That individual was also a traveler, but clearly as they continued to diagnose more, we found people that had no risk through travel and this is what we call community spread.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","10:58"
"Robert Redfield","So we do have community spread. We are continuing to look. We are enhancing our surveillance. We’re blending surveillance for coronavirus into our flu surveillance system. But at this point, I think we have isolated a number of clusters, but it’s not as if we have multiple, multiple hundreds and hundreds of clusters around the United States.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","11:49"

"Donald Trump","I do think what’s happening though is you have people that are sick but they don’t go to the hospital or they’re not very sick. It’s a more minor case and it could be of this virus. But we have a lot of people that aren’t going to the hospital so we’re not seeing those people. And if you did see those people, I believe, [inaudible 00:12:29] service, the statistics actually become much better because they heal, they get better. They don’t see a doctor, they don’t see a hospital. They have a problem, they have the sniffles or a cold or [inaudible 00:12:40], some of the symptoms, and over a period of time, a short period of time or even a longer period of time, they get better.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","12:11"
"Donald Trump","If you look at that, then all of a sudden you’re coming into a much lower category of risk in terms of death type risk. Because I think a lot of people aren’t going to the doctors, a lot of people aren’t going to hospitals and so you’re not seeing those people.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","12:47"
"Alex Azar","And Mr. President, you wouldn’t have seen this. But actually today, Dr. Fauci published in the New England Journal of Medicine, a revised estimate of fatality counts very much consistent with what the president was saying, which is the WHO numbers are just a math problem. This many people died, this many were diagnosed. But if you then extrapolate to from the number of diagnosed to how many likely cases there are that never came to the doctor or hospital or got tested, Dr. Fauci’s paper in the New England Journal says he thinks it’s less than 1% which is I think word for word Mr. President, what you were saying.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","13:01"
"Reporters","Can I just ask one question about containment? You’re saying that you have [crosstalk 00:13:40] seen these clusters, but from last Friday to today we’ve gone from something like 57 or 59 cases, in seven days we have 200, and we even haven’t had the testing to see if there are more than that. So now we’re actually getting the testing, don’t you think it’s likely there are a lot more people out there who are going to come and actually be sick?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","13:36"
"Robert Redfield","I think there’s no doubt we’re going to see more community cases. And I just want to say, and there’s no doubt that the public health system of the United States is enhancing surveillance in a variety of ways to try to really understand is there any hidden pockets. That’s all in process, but I will say everyone has been aggressively using the single case they diagnosed then to go look at all the contacts to try to begin to understand this. This is how the nursing home is.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","14:02"
"Robert Redfield","A lot of infections in Seattle and tragically, and they’re all in our prayers, a number of deaths for that nursing home. So I just want to assure the American public that we are enhancing our surveillance, not just CDC, but the entire public health system of this nation, so that we will have very accurate eyes on where this virus is.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","14:34"
"Speaker 5","Obviously Mr. President we’ve talked a lot about the health ramifications and of course it’s very important, but there are also economic ramifications. The stock market [inaudible 00:15:03] at the end of the day, then the travel industry, airlines, cruise ships, their companies, travel companies have been hit especially hard. Can you give us a sense of what your considering to help offset [inaudible 00:15:13]?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","14:53"
"Donald Trump","Well, we’re considering different but we’re also considering the fact that last year you had approximately 36000 deaths due to what’s called the flu. When I first heard this four or five, six weeks ago, when I was hearing the amount of people that died of the flu, I was shocked to hear anywhere from 27000 to 70000 or 77000, and I guess they said in 1990, that wasn’t particular very bad. It was higher than that. As of the time I left the plane with you, we had 240 cases, that’s at least what was on a very fine network known as Fox News. I know you love it, but that’s what I happened to be watching. And how was the show last night?

But what happened is if you look at the number, the time we left, it was 240 cases, Peter, and 11 deaths. That’s what it has been. You look at throughout the world, I mean other countries have..

"Donald Trump","So we have 240 cases, 11 deaths, everything is too much and it’s true. I don’t want 11 deaths. I don’t want any deaths. Over the last long period of time, when people have the flu, you have an average of 36,000 people dying. I never heard those numbers. I would have been shocked. I would have said does anybody die from the flu? I didn’t know people died from the flu. 36,000 people died. 27,000 to 77,000, that’s your flu.

Now, if you look at the percentage, the percentage for the flu is under 1%, but this could also be under 1% because many of the people that aren’t that sick don’t report, so they’re not putting those people in there, and you’re smiling when I say that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","17:09"

They’d rather quarantine people on the land. Now, when they do that, our numbers are going to go up. Our numbers are going to go up.

I think that just gives people great confidence as they’re traveling through all the airports across the country that the people that are coming in have been screened from those problem areas. The [inaudible 00:24:40] and border people are checking them as well and having conversations. I think they may have tested one person in the Atlanta Airport.

"Robert Redfield","Before that, I just wanted to add one other thing to the availability of clinical tests. The Secretary and the Vice President, last week, brought together all of the major diagnostic companies that you all know so well. Labcorp, Quest, and asked them to come together as a group and they already formed a consortia to work together to use their capacity, which is really substantial, to bring this tests to doctors’ offices around our nation. And when they presented it, they felt that either by Monday, they’re going to begin to roll out this test now through Labcorp, through Quest.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","28:21"
"Robert Redfield","So as the President said, the issue now is whether the clinicians believe that this is indicated in evaluating the patients that come to see them. It’s not going to be about the availability of the test. It’s going to be about the clinical judgment of the patient and the doctor, or the nurse practitioner to get this test.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","29:02"

They would like to have the people come off. I’d rather have the people stay, but I’d go with them. I told them to make the final decision. I would rather it because I like the numbers being where they are, I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn’t our fault, and it wasn’t the fault of the people on the ship either. It wasn’t their fault either, and they’re mostly Americans, so I can live either way with it. I’d rather have them stay on, personally, but I fully understand if they want to take them off.

"Steve Monroe","Yeah, just one point of clarification, the South Koreans I recall, they’re doing drive through sample collection, so this is not like a pregnancy test where you drive through, they take a swab, and they tell you on the spot if it’s positive or negative. They’re using that as a way to collect samples from a large number of people, and then they’re using the high throughput testing platforms in order to do the testing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","32:09"

"Robert Redfield","And I think it’s important just to emphasize again back to the role that CDC had to support the public health labs. We have built the laboratory capacity throughout our public health labs to monitor for flu and other respiratory viral systems. The platform that does that is the platform of the test that we developed. It wouldn’t have helped us to develop a test in the public health labs, and they have none of the instrumentation. We develop using that platform for public health labs. Platform that the secretary and Dr. Monroe was saying is a high throughput platform, which has been put in most hospitals for HIV, Hepatitis C and so that’s the platform. And as we sit here today, we’re trying to now validate whether the test we made would be validated to use that on that platform? But the private sector is already doing it too. I mean they’re moving now to that rapid throughput platform.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","32:39"

If you look at what they’ve done with HIV, it’s incredible. Other countries are all calling the same people that you’re dealing with. And honestly, what you should be doing is giving them a lot of credit because this was a very condensed period of time. Even the vaccine, they’re going to have tests done in 90 days that two years ago you were taking two years to do. And their making great progress. It takes a period of time, but they’re making great progress. Other countries are dealing with the same people you’re talking to now and others in this government universe they’re incredible people, and honestly, you should be giving them tremendous credit.

Something like this could happen. I think we’re doing a really good job in this country at keeping it down. We’ve really been very vigilant, and we’ve done a tremendous job at keeping it down. But who would’ve thought, look how long ago is it? Six, seven, eight weeks ago? Who would’ve thought, would he be having this subject? We were going to hit 30,000 on the Dow.

They spotted something going on in China. When you see these labs that I just saw, I would love to have them see it if it’s possible, but they spotted something going on in China. They started working on it immediately. Just in case it should come here, and also to help China. I mean if we could find something that’s beneficial, we want to give it to China, like they’re going to want to give it to us. China’s working very closely with us, South Korea, Italy, all of them.

"Donald Trump","We don’t have a forecast because we don’t know. We don’t know how many people have this aren’t going to see a doctor, aren’t going to see a hospital. And the higher that number is, the better the number is from the standpoint of death, the death count. They get better without seeing doctors, without seeing the hospitals. So nobody’s marking it down and I think the number is very high. I think that number is much higher, but it never gets reported because they’re not going to hospitals or doctors. The ones that get reported are people that are really sick enough to go to a hospital or to a doctor.

"Robert Redfield","Well, I would just say we’re at a stage in our experience with this virus that we are still deeply focused on control. Some people use the word containment to control. And I said about the important principles of early diagnosis, isolation, and contact rates. And then now with some mitigation strategies, you see in different areas when they’re deciding should we close large gatherings? I think it’s important to use the data and the science that we have. I mean we’re not blind to where this virus is right now in the United States. And we need to focus our resources right now where we know this virus is circulating substantially in the community like certain parts of California, like certain parts of Seattle.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","41:06"
"Robert Redfield","That’s where we need to put our focus. It would not be a service to our ability for our American response. If all of a sudden 20 million Americans that have no evidence of any risks that we’ve looked in those areas really don’t need that. That’s why we are accelerating as the President said our surveillance. I mean we’re going out and really testing people that have flu like symptoms, and we’re going to expand that from the sites we started to the whole nation.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","41:57"
"Robert Redfield","So we’re going to have eyes on this and see. Whoops, this virus has now snuck up into Northern Maine. Whoops, we see it down in Kansas and that information will then be used by doctors to know if someone comes in with an upper respiratory flu, I better think about maybe testing for Coronavirus. So we really want to have the American people to have confidence. It’s not just in CDC, it’s in the public health community of this nation. It’s strong. They’re doing their job. I tell people every time we see a new confirmed case, they should think of that as a success, not a failure because they know their public health community’s out doing their job.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","42:24"
"Donald Trump","The difference is that they’re being proactive. We are being proactive. We’re going out and looking for spots. Nobody else is doing that. Not by leaving samples or anything else. We’re going out and proactively looking to see where there’s a problem. We don’t have to do that, but we’re doing it to see if we can find areas which are trouble spots. I don’t even know if I agree with that. You’ll find out those areas just by sitting back and waiting, but they’re trying to find out before you would normally find out by waiting. And I think that’s great, but that’s what they’re doing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","43:01"

"Robert Redfield","So right now you shouldn’t think of it as one or the other. All right. And I’m going to say we need to stay committed to containment. And I still believe containment and control is the goal, but that’s going to be complimented strategically by what we call mitigation or non-pharmaceutical interventions. Like asking churches not to have big gatherings. So in the state of Washington in the last couple of days, they announced their initial mitigation strategies. We’ve been working on mitigation for the whole nation, just in a planning way. But we’ve also have our people buried into the Washington Health Department, the California Health Department, and have them start to develop.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","43:47"
"Robert Redfield","And again, Washington started to operationalize theirs this week. I suspect California will later. We’re going to continue to work on these. And it’s going to be a community by community, community, community strategy. They’re not all going to be the same, but it’s going to be driven by the amount of community transmission that can’t be linked to a contact that can’t be linked to a trip. When you see significant, or we call on-link transmission then you start to have to evaluate the value. So it’s not one versus the other. But this nation should not give up on containment.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-visits-cdc-calls-jay-inslee-a-snake","Transcript: Donald Trump Visits CDC, Calls Jay Inslee a “Snake”","44:29"
