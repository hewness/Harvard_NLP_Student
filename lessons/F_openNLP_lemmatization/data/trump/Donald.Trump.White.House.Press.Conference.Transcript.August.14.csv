"Donald Trump","So we have some very interesting news. Kevin Clinesmith, a corrupt FBI attorney who falsified FISA warrants in James Comey’s very corrupt FBI is expected to plead guilty. You probably heard that, it just came out. So that’s just the beginning I would imagine because what happened should never happen again so he is pleading guilty. Terrible thing, terrible thing. The fact is they spied on my campaign and they got caught and you’ll be hearing more.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-white-house-press-conference-transcript-august-14","Donald Trump White House Press Conference Transcript August 14","00:00"
"Donald Trump","Today the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy released a new report on how my administration has harnessed the full power of the Defense Production Act to achieve the greatest industrial mobilization since World War II in our fight against the China virus. New factories, businesses and laboratories are being built all over America to match our nation’s demand for personal protective equipment. Pharmaceuticals, drugs, testing supplies, therapeutics and vaccines. It’s been incredible what we’ve been able to do in a very short period of time. We’re helping other countries also because we’ve been doing it at a level that nobody’s ever seen before.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-white-house-press-conference-transcript-august-14","Donald Trump White House Press Conference Transcript August 14","00:48"
"Donald Trump","It was just announced a little while ago industrial production rose for the third straight month, it’s a big thing. Factory output was up 3.4% this month after a 5.7% increase last month. Those are getting to be record numbers and manufacturing capacity utilization is now up to almost 70% so we’re coming back very strong. We should have a very good third quarter and we should have an unbelievably good next year. Next year if we don’t mess it up with somebody that has no idea what they’re doing, could be a fantastic year. My administration has exercised the authority under the Defense Production Act to a number and a related authorities [inaudible 00:02:29] 78 times, disbursing over $3.5 billion to speed the development in manufacturing of essential materials.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-white-house-press-conference-transcript-august-14","Donald Trump White House Press Conference Transcript August 14","01:37"
"Donald Trump","So to put it a little bit differently, the administration has exercised the authority under the Defense Production Act and related authorities 78 times. That’s a lot, Peter, right? It’s a big number. 78 times. Came in very handy. A lot of times we just mentioned it and they did what we asked them to do. Disbursing over $3.5 billion to speed the development and manufacturing of essential materials. I’ve used the DPA more comprehensively than any president in history. It was a time when the media would say why aren’t you using it, why aren’t you using it. Well we have used it a lot, where necessary, only where necessary. For the most part, we’ve had tremendous cooperation. By invoking the DPA, we mobilized the extraordinary productive might of General Motors to manufacture ventilators, GM repurposed the Kokomo, Indiana plant in just 17 days, an all-time record and has now produced over 21,000 ventilators. We’re also working with Ford Motor Company and General Electric to produce over 30,000 ventilators a month. In Michigan, they’ve done a great job. Our nation is now the king of ventilators. I say that, the king of ventilators. We’re sending them all over the world and helping a lot of countries that could never have ventilators and it’s a really … I guess we’re looking to produce over 200,000 ventilators by the end of the year. Those are some numbers.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-white-house-press-conference-transcript-august-14","Donald Trump White House Press Conference Transcript August 14","02:37"
"Donald Trump","So we’re helping a lot of countries. In April, I directed 3M to increase its manufacturing of N95 masks. By May they had increased production by over a million masks a day. Think of that, they increased the production of masks by over one million a day. 3M is now manufacturing an additional 39 million masks a month. We also worked with Honeywell to open factories in Arizona and Rhode Island. They are now producing over 20 million masks a month. By the end of the year domestic U.S. manufacturing will have produced over one billion N95 respirators and all of them are made right here in the USA. That’s a big difference from the past.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-white-house-press-conference-transcript-august-14","Donald Trump White House Press Conference Transcript August 14","04:15"
"Donald Trump","Overall we’ve increased N95 mask production by 400 million masks a year. Now the media might say why not 500, why not 600. Nobody’s seen numbers like this ever. We delivered more than $75 million in support to Puritan Medical in Maine. I was up there, as you remember we had a tremendous visit and tremendous throngs of people along the roads, along the way to Puritan Medical. Puritan has doubled their production of testing swabs from 20 million to 40 million a month. They’re doing a fantastic job and so is Maine. I will also use the DPA to fight price gouging and hoarding. My administration located and seized over half a million pieces of hoarded personal protective equipment including 299,000 pairs of medical grade gloves, 192,000 N95 respirators and 130,000 surgical masks, that’s hoarding. My administration’s decisive actions have yielded truly incredible results. People have done an incredible job. We’ve replenished the strategic national stockpile that was very badly depleted when we took office and totally neglected in the last administration. Since the start of the pandemic we have tripled the number of N95 masks on hand to over 40 million, tripled the number of gowns to over 15 million and quadrupled the number of ventilators to 69,000.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-white-house-press-conference-transcript-august-14","Donald Trump White House Press Conference Transcript August 14","05:03"
"Donald Trump","By September the Strategic National Stockpile Inventory is on track to contain over 300,000, excuse me, 300 million N95 respirators and surgical masks, over 4.5 billion gloves and over 190,000 ventilators. It’s far more than we’ve ever done before. It’s not even close. As we talk about the economy, we continue to restore America’s industrial might. We’re bringing more jobs to the USA, we understand that the economic health is critical, very critical to public health. We’ll be discussing next week some of the outstanding numbers we have compared to any other country. There is no country even close when you look at what we’ve done compared to them from the standpoint of the economy and also even during the period of the China virus.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-white-house-press-conference-transcript-august-14","Donald Trump White House Press Conference Transcript August 14","06:46"
"Donald Trump","In the last three months we’ve added an average of 100,000 jobs every single day. We’ve also added over 620,000 manufacturing jobs in the past three months, that’s despite people saying you can’t do manufacturing jobs, you need a magic wand they said but they were wrong. Weekly jobless claims just fell below one million for the first time in a long time. I am pleased to announce that as part of Operation Warp Speed the federal government will be partnering with McKesson Corporation, great company, which is a major medical supplier to rapidly distribute a China virus vaccine as soon as one is approved, fully approved. They’re in Stage III trials. We have many of them going along different passes. Also many different companies doing them. Very, very incredible companies. We currently have three candidates in Phase III clinical trials and are on pace to have more than 100 million doses of a vaccine ready before the end of the year and 500 million doses very shortly thereafter and we’re ready logistically to distribute them, our military is ready. We have a great general who’s in charge, that’s what he does is he distributes things, usually it’s people and weapons, tanks, but in this case it’s a vaccine or therapeutic as it may be.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-white-house-press-conference-transcript-august-14","Donald Trump White House Press Conference Transcript August 14","07:48"
"Donald Trump","We continue to actively monitor the virus, executing our strategy to protect the vulnerable and prevent hospital overcrowding. As of today, hospitalizations continue to be very stable and we will be watching always very carefully, remain vigilant. We ask every citizen to practice good hygiene, socially distance, wear a mask when distancing is not possible and to protect the elderly, always protect the elderly. So now we’ll take a few questions if you’d like.

"John","Mr. President, on the issue of more money for the U.S. Postal Service and mail-in balloting, if the Democrats were to give you some of what you want, which you articulated in a series of tweets in the last hour, would you be willing to accept the $25 billion for the Postal Service including the $3.5 billion for mail-in voting?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-white-house-press-conference-transcript-august-14","Donald Trump White House Press Conference Transcript August 14","09:50"
"Donald Trump","Sure, if they give us what we want and it’s not what I want, it’s what the American people want. So in addition to … Just, I think, John, as part of your answer, I can read this but in addition to the executive orders that we signed which are going to be doing terrific things in terms of payroll tax cut, which is a lot of money coming to a lot of people very quickly. I’ve directed the Secretary of the Treasury to get ready and send direct payments, $3,400.00 for a family of four to all Americans. Democrats are holding this up. I am ready to have the UST and SBA send additional PPP payments to small businesses that have been hurt by the China virus. Democrats are holding this up. So we’re talking about … Those are two things directly involved and really victim of the China virus we’re ready to send, Democrats are holding up. I’m ready to send rental assistance payments to hardworking Americans that have been hurt by the China virus. All of these things are on a list. Democrats are holding this up. I’m ready to send $105 billion to the states to help open schools safely with additional PPE and Democrats are holding this up. So that’s $105 billion to the states to help open schools safely with additional PPE. Democrats are holding that up.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-white-house-press-conference-transcript-august-14","Donald Trump White House Press Conference Transcript August 14","10:09"

"Speaker 3","Mr. President, I just want to follow up on that and then a quick question.

A lot of people said would you take it, I said I’ll take it if they want or I’ll go first or last.

Look at Oregon, look at what’s going on in Oregon. They have … I don’t think they have a clue. We could stop that.

No, what he did is they made a terrible deal with Iran and the deal was a horror show and I ended it. They gave them $150 billion for nothing. They gave them $1.8 billion in cash for nothing. They got nothing from that deal except trouble. They did nothing, just like they’ve been weak on China, they’ve been weak on Russia, they’ve been weak on everyone and they were the weakest of all on Iran. That was a great deal made by very talented people that work with me and it’s been praised all over the world and what you’ll see now is other countries will come into that deal and you’ll have peace in the Middle East and Biden doesn’t even know … He doesn’t even know the name of the countries I’m talking about.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-white-house-press-conference-transcript-august-14","Donald Trump White House Press Conference Transcript August 14","17:42"
