"President Trump","… extraordinary experts with us. I’d like to maybe start off by asking our vice president to say a few words, and then if you would, Betsy and Kellyanne, and we’ll go around and talk to some of the parents and teachers. And thank you all for being here very much. Appreciate it. Please.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","00:26"
"Vice President","Well, thank you Mr. President. And I want to thank all of the educators and leaders who are here and a part of a conversation. President Trump made it clear from the time that we made our way through the difficult days of 45 days to slow the spread. The president said, we want to work with states to open up America again, but to open up America, we’ve got to open up America’s schools. And at the president’s direction, we’ve literally provided billions of dollars already to states to begin to open schools. And Secretary DeVos and I, as you know Mr. President, have traveled around the country to places like North Carolina and Indiana and Louisiana. And we are working, literally, day in and day out with governors and state education leaders to find a way that we can safely reopen our schools. Our commitment is to make sure that that our states and our schools have the best guidance. And we’ll talk a little bit about that today.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","00:44"
"Vice President","The CDC actually issued some new guideposts, Mr. President, not long ago, but the first document they issued was the CDC’s position that it is best for our kids to be back in school. That the CDC’s recognized that it’s a public health priority to have our kids back to school and in-person learning. But Mr. President, as you’ve also made clear, we’re going to make sure our schools and our states have the resources to be able to safely reopen. And we’re calling on Congress to work with us to appropriate another $105 billion. We believe that we can safely reopen our schools. We know that it’s best for our kids. We don’t want them to fall behind academically, but also we don’t want our kids to miss out on the counseling that they receive, special needs services, as well as all the nutrition programs that are available just at our schools.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","01:48"
"Vice President","And finally Mr. President, and I know that you’ve recognized from early on that getting our kids back to school is first a priority for them, but also it’s important for working families. Only about 20% of single parents are able to tele-work. And so to open up America again, we’ve got to open up America’s schools. To put America back to work, we’ve got our kids who are back in the classroom. And so Mr. President, I want to thank you for your leadership. It’s great to be here with Secretary of Education, with Kellyanne and all these remarkable teachers in particular. As you know, I’ve been married to a school teacher for 35 years. She’s preparing to go back to the classroom this fall. And I want to thank all the educators who are here for all the hard work you’ve done through these difficult days and all the work that you’re doing to get our kids back to school. Thank you, Mr. President.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","02:42"
"Betsy DeVos","Mr. President, thank you so much for your continued bold leadership through this crisis. And particularly with respect to getting kids back to school, it’s been a privilege to travel with the vice president to meet with educators, education leaders, and especially with parents and students to hear about what their needs are as a fall quickly approaches. And so I’m just thankful to be here with this group today, to listen and learn from you about what your needs are as we anticipate getting back to school. And Commissioner Corcoran, thank you for your bold leadership in Florida, really setting high expectations for all of the students and educators there. We know that for students and their families, they can’t be held captive to other people’s fears or agendas. We have got to ensure that families and parents have options that are going to work for their child and for their children’s education. And so I look forward to this conversation to as to how we can ensure that we do not have a one size fits all approach, but that we do ensure every child has a chance to go on learning full time this fall.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","03:34"
"Kellyanne Conway","Thank you very much. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Secretary DeVos, we’re here mainly to hear from each of you today. Before I do that, I just wanted to point out that there is a fairly recent Kaiser Family Foundation health tracker poll that shows over 65% of America’s parents are very concerned that their children will fall behind academically and socially if they don’t get back to school. Having said that, we recognize that many school districts have already made a decision to either go hybrid or full time, virtual learning for the first month or two or maybe longer. So our goal today, the president’s goal has always been, how do we reopen safely?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","04:50"
"Kellyanne Conway","How do we reopen soon? But how do we reopen safely? We also recognize that a number of teachers, particularly the 10% or so that are over the age of 60 in most of our schools are concerned. So we have given resources and guidance that allows each of those districts to make those decisions, to maybe modify the work schedules of the teachers and other administrative staff that may be affected. But overall, we know that the risk is low for kids in contracting and being hospitalized and of course the worst possible outcome, dying from COVID-19. That risk is very high if they’re locked down indefinitely. Nearly 100% of our 75 million students, K through college, left their places of learning, left those structures between the first and third weeks of March of this year. And we see that all situations were not created equally. The lack of digital assets was very obvious for many of our students, the lack of nutrition, the lack of social and emotional, mental wellbeing and development.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","05:27"
"Kellyanne Conway","But also we heard from many school administrators and teachers, they’re concerned because roughly one out of five child abuse cases are detected in schools. So we have to also think about all that we don’t know and all that is being lost for these children by keeping them locked down indefinitely. So in the interest of opening soon and safely for this entire country, Mr. President, we’d like to start with Elisa from Waukesha, Wisconsin. She’s a single mother and a small business owner. And her son, Luis is entering a public district school, the ninth grade, I believe. Freshman year for Luis.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","06:25"

"Kellyanne Conway","If you can tell us a couple of things, Elisa. First of all, what were the relatives advantage or disadvantage of him being a bilingual student when you had to go virtual learning? And then we understand that your school district has not yet announced a reopening plan and we’re in pretty much mid August. So can you address both of those for us.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","07:03"
"Elisa","Correct? Yes. We, as the parents, we had to take a survey regarding either going back to school or going virtual. So at the moment like you had mentioned, we do not have an answer yet. Hopefully we do. And I’m hoping that we do go back because all the details that you just mentioned are very critical and important. And I am 100% of what you guys are saying at the moment. It was kind of difficult for him because it’s really hard being bilingual and having to learn two different languages. But with the help of teachers and the community, he stood up and did a great job. That was the advantage that when he needed help, teachers were there to help him and fulfilled whatever gap was not being covered. And so he did pretty well after that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","07:20"

"Kellyanne Conway","Dr. Paul Peterson is the director of the program on education, policy and governance at Harvard University and Hoover Institution, senior fellow. Dr. Peterson. We’ve heard an awful lot, including from the president, the vice president, CDC director, and others about their relative problems that children could face if they are in indefinite lockdown. Would you please expand on that as a doctor?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","08:37"
"Dr. Paul Peterson","Well, we know that for every year that you spend in school, in the future, you will earn 10% more in lifetime earnings. So if we lock down schools for a year, we assign this generation of students to a 10% earning loss in the rest of their life. I mean, this is profound that the costs are vastly greater than people have appreciated. To say nothing about the importance of young people being together with one another, the most important element in social growth is being with your peers, with your own friends and neighbors and not being isolated in a setting where you don’t have social relationships. To say nothing of the medical costs of being isolated and not… I remember when I was a child, the teacher said, “He can’t see. He needs glasses.” Well, I’ve got some new eyes now. So I can see.

"Dr. Paul Peterson","At one time, Mr. President, I thought digital learning was the future, but we have learned through this COVID crisis that we haven’t got digital learning to the point where you can really engage young people.

They have to be with their peers.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","10:20"

"Lynn Gronseth","My sons a physician, and I will say radiologist at Stanford. And so every time there were rumors and myths, I just called him and said, “What are you hearing there?” And he never once, not once said, “Please don’t go back.” He knows how much I love my special education students, how much they need those special resources like your speech my other colleagues provide.

Dr. Melanie McGraw Piasecki from Charlotte, North Carolina, a neonatologist, but also a mom of three who I think has been home with the kids, helping them navigate the online world of learning. Could you tell us both a mom of three who’s been home with them, but also through your medical experience, how can we learn to safely and quickly return to school?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","12:06"
"Dr. Melanie McGraw Piasecki","Sure. My children, I would say, did not have a great experience in the spring. Particularly my youngest who was in first grade at the time. I think the online learning for the young ones, it just doesn’t work. And my school, it’s a private independent school, recognized that. And when they go back next week, they’re sending the little ones back every day, which I think is great. The middle and upper school ones, will be back in a hybrid way every other day.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","12:32"
"Dr. Melanie McGraw Piasecki","And they’ve incorporated some choice too. So if parents are not comfortable, they’re able to do a full online experience, but we’re definitely going back as much as they’ll let us. In terms of being a pediatrician, I just think the science is so clear that the risk of death or hospitalization for children with this virus is so, so low. But we know the risk of missing school are catastrophic. We probably don’t even know how high they are yet. And they cover so many different areas.

"Kellyanne Conway","Nilsa Alvarez. Hi. It sounds like your children are back in school, following a decision that you and other parents in Seymour Tennessee had to make with respect to whether to keep them at home and learn virtually, or go back to school. You chose to go back to school. Why? And how is it going so far?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","14:07"

And I know a lot of families, it’s a struggle if you’re working your business and being teacher at the same time, it’s just not easy. But we’ve made that decision, and I really want to thank the leadership of Governor Bill Lee, who emphasized to the school districts to offer the options of in-person learning and virtual, so that parents would have the freedom to choose which education route would be best for their child. The parents in my area, and at our school, decided to send our kids back. Our kids are excited. There is social distancing. There’s a lot of protocols in place. Their temperatures are taken every morning. Everything is going very smooth, but what is really good is that my son and daughter, they understand the seriousness of the virus for those at risk.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","14:23"

We have a group chat with the parents and we’re communicating all the time, if there’s any symptom so that we know to if something’s happening or not, whether we send our kids back to school that day or not.

I know as governor of Indiana, Vice President Pence expanded charter schools and other educational freedom opportunities.

She’s a reading specialist, her zone school district plans to provide full time virtual instruction. She believes her high schooler will be fine, but her-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","19:48"
"Kellyanne Conway","… full time, virtual instruction. She believes her high schooler will be fine, but her kindergarten has down syndrome and must receive in-person instruction. Janie’s husband, Chris, is here. He serves as the chairman of the president’s Committee for People with Intellectual Disabilities. Thank you very much for being here, Chris. And God bless both of you and your children. Would you like to tell us a little bit, Janie, about how you’re approaching the school year?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","20:03"
"Janie","Absolutely. When schools closed in the spring abruptly, it was especially difficult for families with children that have special needs, because for us, it was like falling off an early intervention cliff. Schools not only provide the academics for students with special needs, but it also provides the much needed therapies and services to address developmental delays. And the structure and routine of school day is so critical for this population of students. It simply cannot be replicated in a virtual platform, and especially for a kindergartner with down syndrome.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","20:23"
"Janie","Unfortunately, our school district has adopted a virtual only reopening plan. And it’s been extremely disappointing because, as a parent, I wish… well, I need, and I wish that I’d been given a choice. Because I know for a fact that this style of learning will cause my son to regress and to fall behind. And we were working so hard for him to be fully included with his peers. So, my hope is that we can all work together to get in-person learning, especially open for the students that are most vulnerable, and to have that choice for parents. Because I know my son best, and I know what he needs.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","20:59"
"President Trump","That’s really well said. So, it’s been a burden, a tremendous burden. And what you’ve been through has been a great burden, obviously. How do they change that? How do they change it? What would you recommend?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","21:38"
"Janie","I think families with children with special needs, we’re already carrying a pretty tremendous burden. We are constantly incorporating different therapies and things of that nature. What’s nice about it being incorporated in the school is that it happens during the school day.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","21:54"
"Janie","Unfortunately, in my situation, we’ve now been forced to change and to find another school option for our son. We’re fortunate because a lot of families don’t have that option because smaller schools, private schools, parochial schools may not have the staff and the structure to accept children with special needs. So, there’s not always that option. We’re fortunate in that situation. But now, my family has taken on the burden of not budgeting and planning for tuition. So, having the dollars follow the student is very critical for a family like ours. And now, I’m also having to plan all of his therapies on the outside. So, we’re talking about a kindergartner that’s going to school from eight in the morning to two, 2:30 in the afternoon, and then he has to have occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, all after school. That’s a long day.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","22:08"

"Chris","Thank you. I think the conversation in America right now, the children with special needs have really been left out. And so, Mr. President, and I want to thank this administration. Mr. Vice President, when you and the secretary came to Columbia a few weeks ago, you addressed that issue, that people with disabilities are being left out. And so, what we have here are people that are on the front lines in education that are saying we can open the schools for everyone. I visited two schools this week in South Carolina that have charter schools. Students are in class. Teachers are there. They’re learning. They’re playing with each other. I mean, it’s been a great experience. So, we can do this in America. We can get America back to school and make our education system great.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","23:05"

"Kellyanne Conway","Florida’s Commissioner of Education, Mr. Corcoran, you spearheaded an emergency declaration with Governor DeSantis, basically to meet the demands of parents for in-person instruction. I’m very struck when I read these parent surveys in many districts. Parents overwhelmingly are saying, yes, when they are asked, do you feel it is safe for your son or daughter to return to school? And often, they’re being big footed by a county health commissioner or a school board. How are you meeting that demand? And how do you know that parents are so in demand in Florida for in person instruction? What are you hearing?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","23:55"
"Mr. Corcoran","Well, we did exactly as you said. We did an emergency order that basically gave increased flexibility and increased choice to parents, teachers, and the districts and a certainty in the funding. And what we were saying and what got reported the same day you said open schools, so they said, we colluded. I wish I colluded with you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","24:28"

"Mr. Corcoran","But we opened up. We said, you have to open up as an option five days a week for school children. And now, in Florida, we’re in August. Our first schools are opening up this week. And, throughout August, we’ll have all 67 of our districts will open up. We’ve not approved a single plan, to your point and your point, even in our phase one counties in Southeast Florida, we’ve told them, you better open up for children with unique abilities on day one. You cannot do virtual therapies. You can’t do virtual.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","24:50"
"Mr. Corcoran","And we just had a forum the other day with another parent who had a Down’s child. And he just thrives when he’s around other kids. And, when he’s at home, he’s literally being diagnosed with depression because he’s not around kids. They have to have that right away. And so, we’ll open up. And the great news is we’ll have probably… already, we have 13 districts that opened up this week. Of those 13 districts, this is the amazing thing, to your point, we are being sued by the union bosses. And they are disgraceful, absolutely disgraceful. And so, we have multiple suits going. But the reality is, of the districts that opened up this week, six of them have almost 100% teacher participation. You know what teachers want? Teachers want to be back in the classroom with their kids. Even if they have an underlying condition, they want to be back. And that’s what we’re seeing in Florida.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","25:20"
"Mr. Corcoran","And, when we get to August 31st, all the districts open up. We’re going to have probably 70 to 80% of students in face to face options. And we’ll have more than that percentage in teachers in the classroom with their students. And there’s just no substitute for it. You hear it. We have the largest virtual school in the country. It is a second tier education. The best education is when you’ve got a great teacher, a great mentor, someone who’s got great wisdom, all the children and their peers together getting a great education. And an education we say in is everything. Education is freedom. Education is the uplifting of the human soul to the glorious light of truth. And to deny a child that kind of education, you’re robbing them of a lifetime, not just of earnings, a lifetime of who they are as human beings. And I stole that from Frederick Douglas, but that is really what a education goes to.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","26:06"
"Mr. Corcoran","And I loved what the Royal Academy said. When they said, you’re scarring a generation of children for their futures. That’s what we’re doing when you don’t have that option. But hey, if you’re a parent… I have six children, two in elementary school, one in middle, two in high school, one in college, all public school. All of them are going back to school. But I completely respect and wanted to honor the decision of a parent who says, well, what about, I don’t feel safe? I think the evidence is overwhelming. We’ve all seen it. But you have that right. If you want to do distance learning, we’re going to do the best possible way. But, to the other 70, 80% of us, we have the right too to go back and have our kids get that world class education.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","26:59"

And, for a long time, we’ve been here and how great it would be, how great it would be. Well, we’ve had the ultimate sample, right, namely the whole country practically. And it’s not as good. We’ve also learned that telehealth is very good. Telehealth is up 3,500%. It’s great. Can you imagine that 3,500, where people can stay in their homes, their apartments, wherever they are, and they can not have to go to hospitals, and doctors, and everything else.

She’s one of the parents who said yes to the question, do you feel safe returning your children to school?

"Lindsay Ammann","Yes. Yes. Absolutely. That’s all correct, everything that everyone has already mentioned. We also had a very poor experience with virtual learning. The kindergarten age, I think, is very difficult, as everyone has already spoken about. But she also, it’s important to note, was an absolute lover of learning in general. She is very bright, very eager to learn. And we really watched that all fade. We watched her education deteriorate. And we also really saw her mental health suffer over the course of the spring. So, we were very eager to get her back into in person learning. And we really felt very confident and comfortable with the precautions that were put in place by our district. Originally, we were offered two days in person, three days virtual.

Fortunate for us, we had already kind of gone a different route and set up a homeschool situation for her with a small group of parents in our community and we’re very grateful for that. That was certainly not an easy choice to make. It was an unexpected cost and something we hadn’t planned for, but we felt like it was really, really important for her to be in a classroom setting.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-kids-first-roundtable-transcript-august-12-reopening-schools","Donald Trump ‘Kids First’ Roundtable Transcript August 12: Reopening Schools","30:03"

We know that the harms of locking out the children from school are enormous and we also know, as we all would agree, that educating America’s children is right at the top of the list for our nation’s priority.

They want to do it. I spoke with Trevor Lawrence, the great quarterback, and he’s a very smart. He understood it very well. He said, “Hey, I’m a lot safer in the field that I am being out there.” And he got it. He got it very quickly. Coach O, I spoke with him. He’s some coach that one. He’s a great coach.
