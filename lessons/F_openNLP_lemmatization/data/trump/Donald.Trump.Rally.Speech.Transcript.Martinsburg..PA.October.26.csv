They put the lid on it, they put the lid… And he saw, we had two of these today, they were fantastic. Different parts of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. And we had two of them, ann sleepy Joe was down there and they said, “You got to get out of this basement.” So he traveled from Delaware to a little tiny corner of Pennsylvania, right next to Delaware.

There’s got to be something going.” But one day they came back and these doctors were so great. And there were a lot of them. There’s so many doctors. When you’re president, there’s so many doctors and I had 12 doctors, can you believe it? I’ve never had 12. I’ve had one or two, but I’ve never had 12.

That was good enough for me. That was it. Highly respected person. He’s a highly respected man.

Judge Barrett will be the third Supreme Court Justice along with almost 300, right around the number, by the time we end the first term, I’ll have 300, maybe a little more, maybe a little less, federal judges that we’ve confirmed to uphold our laws and our constitution. And part of that was that Barack Hussein Obama allowed me to have 142. We started with 142 empties. I don’t think anybody’s ever had one. You don’t do that. But he left me 142.

"President Donald J. Trump","To this day, Joe Biden refuses to release his list of names. You know, it’s more than just the packing the court. He’s got to say who is he going to put on, because we can’t have radical left justices that are going to destroy our nation. And we will be very, very careful as to who we choose. You know, I left a list of 45. I had a list of 25 and now I added 20 names, all top scholars, top, top scholars. And Amy was one of them. I took Amy off. And the fact is you have no idea. A lot of people say I won because of the Supreme Court, because they didn’t know who I’d pick, and I gave a list, and I said, “I’ll pick somebody like this.” And then they said, “That’s not good enough. You got to pick somebody in that list.” So ultimately it’s a list of 25, all great scholars, all people that believe in something known as the Constitution, if that’s okay.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-martinsburg-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Martinsburg, PA October 26","timed text issue"

We have a Senate. We have a House, a lot of people. Nine is the right number. Nine great people, that’s the right number. But he’s got to agree to not pack the court.

And then the last one I said, “So you don’t want oil, Joe?” “Well yes, we want to get ourself off of oil.” And how about Kristen? Who I thought treated me good. I really did. I thought she, compared to Chris Wallace, much better, right? Chris Wallace, I was fighting two people. But no, I thought she treated us good.

Dig we must. Clean coal. I don’t call it coal. I call it clean coal. They can do more with coal now. Thank you very much. Remember when Hillary, she said we will stop all coal miners. We will never dig coal again. And then four weeks later, she ended up in West Virginia. That did not work out well for her. That was not good. Remember, she was trying to explain that she was just kidding. Just like he’s doing, just like sleepy Joe’s doing. He was just kidding. But he’s down. We just had a poll come out. We’re plus two now, you know. But we should be a lot more than that. I’m not happy with plus two. I don’t like plus two. It’s an honor. You do a great job. Dig we must. Dig we must. And we brought it back. We’re selling now coal to Vietnam and many, many places from… Are you coal miners from Pennsylvania? Good. Good. That’s good.

Our country’s coming back stronger than anybody would have thought. And you have to get your governor to open up your state, what this guy is doing. You know, we had one site where we had a site, it was a big site, beautiful site, and he made sure that they didn’t do it.

So we’re in court and we had a Pennsylvania judge who said, “Oh, you shouldn’t have poll watchers.” Can you believe that? We actually lost the first case, but we’ll go up and we’ll end up in the Supreme Court.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-martinsburg-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Martinsburg, PA October 26","timed text issue"

Now Joe Biden is trying to ban fracking and deliver an economic death sentence for Pennsylvania’s energy sector. You can’t allow this to happen. But here’s the thing. For a year, I watched him saying, “There will be no fracking,” right? We saw with the Democrats, right? The radical left Democrats. They’re all screaming, “No fracking.” Every one of them, they couldn’t scream loud enough. And he gets the nomination because Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas refused to get out. No, had she gotten out, then crazy Bernie would have been our opponent. But I think I like Joe better because there’s no energy. I liked him.

And he goes back and he goes into the Senate. I think he’s the greatest loser. He’s a really good, he’s a good loser. He’s a good sport. Crazy Bernie. And in the last week’s debate, Joe Biden confirmed his plan to abolish the entire U.S. oil industry. That’s right. And that’s why Kristen said, “Why are you doing this?” Because she’s on his side, you know, because that’s NBC owned by Concast, C-O-N, not C-O-M, C-O-N. So she’s on his side.

That means no fracking, no natural gas, no coal, no jobs, no energy, no Pennsylvania families being well taken care of. Fracking is saving Pennsylvania families $2,500 a year, at least. And it’s saving families all over the country. We are energy independent and you’re a big part of it. And they want to end that. They want to go to wind. Do you love the wind? Nice windmill right alongside of your house. Your house is now worthless. You know, when those windmills go up and they’re near your house, I know a lot about wind, it cost many, many, many times the energy that we’re talking about, many, many times, like 32 cents versus 3 cents, whether it’s natural gas or other things, but many, many times.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-martinsburg-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Martinsburg, PA October 26","timed text issue"

I like solar too, but it still isn’t developed. And solar’s not going to power your big, powerful plants, which we have to have in order to compete and beat the rest of the world. It’s just not going to do it and neither is wind. And neither is wind. He will eradicate Pennsylvania energy production and send your state into a crippling depression.

No, no same thing here because you have the same thing. And you could really say the same thing almost to a little bit lesser extent, but the Texas was just amazing.
