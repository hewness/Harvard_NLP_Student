"Donald Trump","Wow. This is a big crowd. This is a very big crowd. Look at all those cameras over there. Can you show the crowd? Can you show this crowd? They never talk about a crowd. And in reverse, they never talk about Sleepy Joe’s crowd either. It’s about 12 people just showed up. 12. Look at this crowd. Maybe you could take those cameras to just show over there and over there. This is great. Hello, Pennsylvania. Hello, Pennsylvania. We love Pennsylvania. Great education. And also, hello, Reading. We know it well. We know it well. Three days from now, we are going to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and we are going to win four more great years in the White House.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","05:40"
"Donald Trump","I will tell you they’re getting a little nervous back there, the Fake News, because Florida is looking very strong. And these are not suppression polls. These are voters they’re coming in. Florida is looking very good. North Carolina is looking very good. Ohio is looking beyond good. Ohio. You never hear, “You can’t win unless you win the great state of Ohio.” Did you ever hear that? Well, Ohio is looking real good. They’re all looking good. You know what’s looking good? Pennsylvania is looking good. Real good. That great red wave is going to be very beautiful to watch. We’re looking good. And if we win Pennsylvania, it’s over. It’s over. But be careful. You’ve got big tech. You have the Democrats and they play dirty. You have the RINOs. The RINOs are not good people. You’ve got them all.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","06:39"
"Donald Trump","But we’re here and you have your Second Amendment. You have your tax cuts. You have your regulation cuts. You have your fracking. You have your fracking. How about Joe? He goes for a year, “There will be no fracking. I tell you, there will be no fracking.” He comes to Pennsylvania, listen, we have a million jobs for fracking. We like $2 gasoline. It’s nice, isn’t it? We’ve got a lot of things. “Well, in that case, let me just change my …” And he never even gets asked about it by the fake news. Can you believe it? With your support, we will continue to bring back your jobs, cut your taxes, cut your regulations, and ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful term, “Made in the U.S.A.” And next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. You see it’s already going. You saw what happened. You saw those numbers come out. You have to look very closely.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","07:45"
"Donald Trump","A man got on television yesterday and said, “This is probably the greatest economic day in the history of our country,” and the papers barely even put it in. It’s called suppression, suppression. And Joe Biden will shut down your economy. Well, you’re already shut down in Pennsylvania. Hey Governor, you’ve got to open up. You’ve got to open up the state, Governor. You’ve to open it up. And don’t cheat in the ballots, Governor. Don’t cheat. Don’t cheat. We’re going to win. We’re going to win. The only way we can lose this state and the numbers are in, you see what’s going on, somebody’s going to play games. And they just got an extension. What’s the extension all about? Wouldn’t you like to hear, “November 3rd, we win. We lose. We win. We lose. Whatever.” November 3rd, now you have more time, more time. What’s going on? That was a very disappointing opinion, but I’ve had many disappointing opinions from the Supreme Court. I will tell you. Many, many disappointing opinions from the Supreme Court. They talk about we control the Supreme Court. We don’t control the Supreme Court. That was a terrible decision.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","08:44"
"Donald Trump","Joe Biden will shut down your economy, wipe out your factories, and shut down your state. Ship your jobs to China. Raise your taxes $4 trillion. The biggest tax increase in the history of our country. And I gave you the biggest tax cut in the history of it. He’ll eliminate your private healthcare. 180 million people have the best healthcare. They work so hard and they negotiated with many great companies and have the best healthcare. They want to knock it out. They want you to live on socialized medicine. I don’t think you’ll be too happy. “Darling, I have a call.” “Oh. Go to the hospital room.” You’ll wait in line for about four days. That’ll be nicer, right? And send your state into a deep and catastrophic depression.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","09:53"
"Donald Trump","And if you look at the stock market, we’ve done great. The only headwind in the stock market, it’s an election, things can happen. We’re doing great. Much better than anyone understands. They’re starting to get very depressed. You talk about a depression. They’re having a hard time. They’re having a hard time with it. But you know what? There’s a headwind. Do you know what the headwind is? That there’s a possibility if Biden wins you’re going to have a stock market collapse the likes of which you’ve never had. You will have a collapse. So that’s our headwind. If we win, if we win on Tuesday, or thank you very much, Supreme Court shortly thereafter, if we win, let me tell you, if we win, you’re going to see a stock market that’s going to go like a rocket ship. 401ks, your 401Ks.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","10:49"

"Donald Trump","This is a very enthusiastic group, isn’t it? This is great. Wow. This doesn’t seem like someone who’s going to come in second, do you agree? I don’t think so. Did you see Biden and Obama before, they made a thing? Honk, honk. Honk. Honk, honk. And actually most of them are our supporters trying to cause a little havoc, but that’s all right. We don’t want that. Biden has vowed to abolish the entire U.S. oil industry. No more fracking, no mining, no heating, no clean coal, and gas prices going up at $5, 6$, and $7 a gallon. So when you pull in with your car, you say, “Darling, I think we’re going to sell this beautiful SUV. Let’s get a compact.” Do you remember the compacts? “The gas is too expensive. What has this guy Biden done?” And the bad part is that Biden doesn’t have a clue. He’s gonzo. We all know it. They just don’t want to say it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","11:57"
"Donald Trump","Biden’s plan, I don’t think he likes me too much, is an economic death sentence for this great commonwealth. It’s a death sentence. He’ll eradicate your economy. Kamala Harris. Did you ever hear of Kamala? You have to pronounce it Kamala. She makes Bernie Sanders look like a strict conservative. Do you know that? Bernie is a conservative member compared to her. I mean, how that choice was made. And did our great Vice President win that debate easily? That was a big one. Mike is doing a great job. The most liberal Senator even sponsored the Green New Deal, $100 trillion. It started off at 100 trillion then 106. Now they have it down to six trillion. No, it’s not six trillion. And by the way, if it was, you couldn’t afford it. But you can afford 100.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","13:22"
"Donald Trump","A vote for Biden and Harris is a vote to ban, and you know this, ban fracking, ban mining, close up your individual plants. They’ve got plants all over the place. I grew up here. They have plants all over. When I say grew up, let me be exact, during college, because they’ll say, “He misrepresented. He said he grew up.” But Biden represents it. “This is my home.” This is not his home. They left. They abandoned you. It wasn’t his fault. He was nine years old or something. It was not his fault. But it’s not like he’s a big Pennsylvania guy. No, he’s a Delaware guy. And Delaware is a good place. In fact, it’s really good. He likes it so much he never leaves. He never leaves. He made the mistake. He came to Pennsylvania three days ago, because I was here. I was doing three of them. Three in Pennsylvania. Hey, I’m devoting a lot of my percentage of time to Pennsylvania. What do you think? I must like you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","14:18"
"Donald Trump","No, we win Pennsylvania. We’re going to win Florida. If we win Pennsylvania, it’s over. Let’s do it. I felt very badly, I felt guilty, because if you remember four years ago, we were at 98% of the vote. If I lost every single vote, there were X number of votes left, if I lost every single vote, every vote, take them all, I still win. They refused to call it. They refused. They wouldn’t call it. I said, “Wait a minute. They have to call it.” Because I was at 98, not 99, I was at 98. It stood there for an hour and a half. And I kept saying, “That’d be nice, Pennsylvania. That’d be nice.” They refused. And then they said, ” Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin.” And then they said, “Donald Trump has won the state of Michigan.” And we won. And then much later, they just refused to give you the credit. So let’s turn it around on them, okay? They didn’t treat you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","15:18"
"Donald Trump","I kept waiting. I said, “Look at Pennsylvania. Why aren’t they going to call it? Why?” They waited for hours and hours. I said, “I’ll concede every vote. I’ll concede every one and we win.” They wouldn’t do that. But we won it, and we won it pretty easily. I think we want it pretty easily. And what I’ve done from the time we won and what I’ve done since then, what we’ve done for this state has been incredible, or to be perfectly accurate. For this commonwealth. But what we’ve done for Pennsylvania has been incredible. You had the best year you’ve ever had last year and you’re heading to the best year you’ve ever had period, and it’s going to be this coming year. Biden would completely destroy Pennsylvania. A vote for me is a vote to remain energy independent. Do you believe it? We can say that. Did you ever think you’re going to hear those beautiful words? We’re energy independent.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","16:21"
"Donald Trump","Our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever recorded. That was what was announced yesterday. The only problem is, a very, very brilliant gentleman called me up. Not a nice man at all. In fact, he’s ruthless and vicious. I love that guy with the beard back there. He goes to a number. Thank you. He’s so distinguished. He’s so distinguished. I see him at so many rallies. I appreciate it. I think he’s great. He’s going, “Four more years.” Yeah. He’s great. But you know what? He got up and he said, very smart, very successful guy, he said, “This could be the biggest announcement in 50 years. 33.1% GDP.” That’s growth. He said it broke the record. It’s the number one in history, of the history of our country.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","17:16"
"Donald Trump","… it broke the record, it’s the number one in history, in the history of our country, and probably the history of any country, if you want to know the truth. But 33.1% which is far greater than people were anticipating, anybody. So what happens is that this is the biggest announcement but you watch, they won’t give you any credit, they’ll try not to mention. It’s true, the press is playing it down so much. Just like for different reasons they refuse to talk, they refuse to talk about where’s Hunter. They refuse to talk about the corruption in Biden’s family. We’ve learned more about the fake news, but this is no longer fake news, this is now corrupt news. This is now corrupt news. We’ve learned a lot. But we had the greatest number we’ve ever had.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","18:03"
"Donald Trump","I thought I heard that from over there. See, I don’t participate in this because look at all the cameras back there, look at them all. You know what they’re going to do? “He’s trying to incite them.” No, I don’t have to incite them, they’re like intelligent people, they know. They know that when you get thrown out of the military and you have no job for a long time, and then your father becomes Vice President, and then you get $183,000, right? $183,000 to sit on a board, probably never went to a board meeting, and supposedly 3 million upfront. And then the mayor of Moscow’s wife gives you a check for 3.5 million, and then… And then, you go in Air Force Two and you go to a very nice place known as China, that should have never, ever done what they did. They should have never done. We just signed a great trade deal and the ink wasn’t dry, and the plague came in. They should have, they could have stopped it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","18:52"
"Donald Trump","But they go to China, father and son goes to China, and he walks out with $1.5 billion to manage, which is millions of dollars a year. And then he goes for the big play, 10 million a year, you saw that one? He wants 10 million a year. This is a guy didn’t have a job a year before. Goes to China, “We want 10 million a year for introductory,” in other words, he’ll introduce people to his father. And then you see his father, the big guy, the big guy, they call him, he’s not a big guy. He’s not a big guy… He’s not a big guy. No.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","19:57"
"Donald Trump","Do you remember like a year ago, year and a half ago, he said, “I’d like to take him to the back of the barn…” A slight slap. You don’t have to close… you didn’t close your fist. Now they said, “He’s inciting violence.” No, no. But when Biden… I thought it was a terrible… Remember that he actually like, “I want to take him to the back of the barn.” They didn’t say the thing. If I said that, they’d say this is a terrible human being, right? It’s all right.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","20:34"
"Donald Trump","You know what? In the meantime we have the White House, right? We have the White House. We have the presidency. We have fracking. We have energy. We have manufacturing that they totally gave up. Remember, you’d need a magic wand. In the past five months, we’ve created a record 11.4 million American jobs, there’s never been that many jobs produced in that short a period of time. While foreign nations are in a free fall, and they are, unfortunately, I feel badly for them, but they are. We are creating the world’s greatest economic powerhouse. We are going to be more powerful than ever before. We had to stop. We had to close. We saved 2 million lives. Remember they, they don’t want to ever talk about that. The model was 2.2 million. That’s what they said. We saved 2 million lives, we closed it up. How would you like to be, ma’am, sitting there, we have the greatest economy of the history of this country, in the history of the world.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","21:15"
"Donald Trump","We were doing so much better than China, I was throwing tariffs on them, they were paying us billion dollars. I gave $28 billion to farmers because they were targeted by China. Iowa, Nebraska, they’ll remember, they’ll remember. I gave them 28 billion with a B, farmers, farms, and ranchers because they were targeted by China because they thought China thought they could use the farmers to get the deal that they want because I said, “I’m not going to let you rip off the United States, you’ve done it long enough, for years and years.” And I’m not just talking about Obama. I’m talking about other presidents too, they allowed this to happen. They allowed this to happen. So we gave our farmers 28 billion, that’s not… all from China. I said, “Please write a letter, say thank you very much, President Xi.” A recent Gallup poll found that 56% of Americans say they are better off today than they were four years ago under… Think of that. And that’s during, we’re rounding the turn, they hate when I say it. You know we’re coming up with the vaccines, the therapeutics are incredible. Here I am, I mean, you know. I’m sure I would have been here without the therapeutic because as you can see I’m in perfect physical shape and I’m extremely young. So I’m young and I’m a perfect physical specimen… No, so I’m sure I could have beat it without… But something happened when I took that sucker and it was gone. It was gone. I woke up the next morning and I ripped off my shirt. I said, “Doctor, let me the hell out of here.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","22:12"
"Donald Trump","And I was campaigning like… very… Oh, the other side, were they happy? Oh, were they happy? But you know what? When you’re President of the United States, you can’t lock yourself into a basement at the White House. Got to be President and meet people, right? I can’t lock myself into the basement, and they have a very good basement, I can’t lock myself into a beautiful bedroom and stay there for a year and a half. The President of the United States is locked in the most magnificent bedroom on the third floor of the White House because we have a pandemic and he’s afraid to go out, he’s your President. No, no, you got to go out.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","23:56"
"Donald Trump","And the doctor came up to me. Great doctors. One thing if you’re President you get good doctors, that’s the one thing I can tell, and you get plenty of them too, they got more doctors. But they came up, “Sir, you’re positive, you just tested positive.” I said, “Doctor, tell me something. For what?” “Sir, you have the China plague.” He didn’t say that, he said, “COVID, sir.” COVID, you know it’s got about 24 different names, most of them should start with the word China because that’s where it came from. They have a word corona, right? The coronavirus. Well, I say what is this a place in Italy? Sounds like an island in Italy. Corona. No, I don’t want it, it’s the China, it’s the China virus, that’s what it is.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","24:35"
"Donald Trump","But he said, “Sir, you just tested positive for COVID.” I said, “Ugh, that’s great. Wait a minute, I got about four campaign stops to make in the next couple of days because we got to win this, this is the most important election in the history of our country.” And then our great First Lady tested positive. Well, at least those rumors that we don’t live together turned out to be false. She lives in a house someplace in Virginia. No. No. She lives with me and she tested… I said, “That’s the only good thing about her testing positive because…” But she’s strong and knocked it out. But then they said, you know that they said, “Sir, Barron,” now, Barron’s my 14-year old boy who’s very tall and strong, he’s very strong, all right? And Barron, they said, “Sir, Baron tested positive.” I said, “Huh, that’s not good.” About 12 minutes later, I said, “How’s Barron doing?” “Sir, he’s shed it, no problem, he’s fine.” Get back to school, Governor, tell them they have to get back to school. Got to get back to school. Those young kids they have that strong, we feel strong, they have that very strong immune system. “How is he?” “He’s 100%.” “Barron, was it bad?” “I don’t think I had anything wrong, Dad.” That’s one of those things, right? That’s the way it is. They’re young and they’re strong and their immune system is good and they should go back to school immediately. Sleepy Joe Biden is a diehard globalist who spent the last 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders, and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars in countries that most of you have never even heard of before. They’re all coming back to soldiers are coming back, you know that. 19 years. So now 19 years and they were policemen, they policed areas, but it’s ridiculous what they were doing in this country. Ridiculous. Biden is a Washington vulture who decimated your steel mills, annihilated your coal jobs, clean coal, and supported every disaster sellout trade deal for over half a century.

"Donald Trump","The real thing that bothered me more than anything else, I thought the wars were crazy. I thought so much was bad, but I saw these trade deals we were making with countries, both ally, and foe, and our allies in many ways treated us worse than the foe, okay. We were treated horribly on trade and we were treated horribly on the military. We had to pay for their military. By the way, those days have ended very substantially you know. Very, very substantially.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","27:48"
"Donald Trump","Biden was a cheerleader for NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals ever made, maybe the worst, and China’s entry into the world trade organization. That’s where China was flat-lined for years and years and then they went up like a rocket ship. You know they’re considered a developing nation. As a developing nation, they get a much better deal than we do. I said, “China is not a developing nation. Or you can let them be, then we’re a developing nation also.” When you think of it, we are a developing nation. And then we won $7.5 billion recently, we hadn’t won anything because the judges within the world trade, the judges treated us with disrespect. But with me, they’re respected because I’ll say, “We’ll pull the hell out of there. We’ll pull out.” And we won 7.5 billion, all of a sudden we’re winning cases.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","28:17"

Let’s not, let’s not listen to the decision, this most important election in the history of our country, November 3rd. Let’s not wait November 3rd, let’s extend the date. Let’s give people more time to put in ballots, right? Why can’t they put their ballots in earlier so you have plenty of time, and so we can have a decision on November 3rd, the evening of November 3rd? And you know what’s going to happen? Especially with Pennsylvania, man was on television yesterday, “We allow five points for cheating,” he said in Pennsylvania, right? Think of that. One of the best pollsters in the country? The one who got it right four years ago. He said, “Trump’s going to win Pennsylvania but you have to allow five points for cheating.” You know when the cheating is going to take place? From the 3rd to whatever the date is that they gave. No, that’s very disappointing. That was a very political decision, I have to say, they have not treated me.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","29:06"

He’s got to go at least one or two sizes larger that don’t look like… I don’t like it. I don’t know, he’s got the silver deal going, the whole deal. And he’s very angry, right? You ever notice? You know what, the word is a… It’s agitated. You know why he’s agitated, right? Because he’s got a problem. “We’ve got to…” And you just hope he can keep it going, but it’s not going to go much longer.

North Carolina is looking pretty good, did you see that? And this is no longer the fake suppression polls. You know we had a thing, Wisconsin is great and we won it last time, and we had a poll come out, I’m up one, then I’m down one, then I’m up one, then I’m even, you know what this is crazy stuff.

It’s not “none of your business”, it’s a much better word. It’s two words that they say. But all those votes were votes for me. So they don’t count them.

While Biden was giving China your jobs, his family was raking in millions of dollars from China, millions and millions of dollars. If Biden wins, China wins. If Biden wins, China will own the US. Just remember that. And with me, it went just the opposite. I will tell you one thing, I can name many countries that would like me to lose. You know they said that Germany, that in Germany, and I have a heritage with Germany, I mean they should like me, but they like Obama much better than they should like Obama. There’s no way they can like me. I said, “Pay up.” They don’t pay their, they’re delinquent in NATO. They owe us billions and billions of dollars. Obama never said, “Pay up.” I said, “You got to pay up otherwise we have to take our troops out.” And then I hear that they like him better, well they should. You know what?

This week the City of Philadelphia, I know it well, was ransacked by violent mobs and Biden supporters. More than 50 great police officers were injured and they weren’t allowed to do their job.

And if you look at our numbers, our numbers are so incredible. And our economy went down much less and it’s come back much, much faster. Biden opposed the China travel ban, he opposed the Europe travel ban. I closed it very early and he said I shouldn’t do it. Think of this, “He shouldn’t do it, he’s xenophobic.” I think he called me a racist too which I don’t like. Look, “He shouldn’t do it, he’s xenophobic.

We know the disease. We’re going to have all of the different things, including the therapeutics which I think might be a cure because something happened to me, I’ll tell you what. Something happened. It might be a cure, but the… they call it therapeutics. But what we’ve done and what we’ve done in terms of mortality rates are incredible. And we’re going to go over that. The Biden lockdown will result in the deaths of Americans from suicide, drug overdoses, deferred medical care, abuse. I mean, you can’t do this. You got to open them up.

You can see it in the way he angrily shouts his speeches. Great agitation. He can never unite us because he’s spent five decades in Washington trying to divide us. For 47 years Joe Biden betrayed black Americans and viciously attacked their communities. In 1994 and that crime bill, that horrible crime bill, he devastated black families, and they know that. And one of the things we’re seeing from other states is he’s not doing very well with African American votes. They don’t like him. I signed landmark criminal justice reform and I announced the platinum plan, which will create 3 million new jobs for black Americans. And deliver school choice for every family in our country. And then he went around in 1994-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","52:51"
"Donald Trump","And then he went around in 1994 and around that time, and started calling young black people super predators. Right? Super predators. You can’t do that, and they remember that, and that’s why he’s doing terribly with African Americans. He’s doing very badly. He’s trying to figure it out. I could say, “Joe, I can figure it out for you, Joe.” I achieved the most secure border in history. Our opponents want open borders. Open borders. If you don’t have borders, you don’t have a country. By the way, the wall is almost complete. 400 plus miles, it will be complete very soon and it’s made a difference. We have the most secure southern border we’ve ever had by far. To protect our security, I suspended the entry of foreign … and you know what this is all about. You’ve been seeing what’s going on in France lately. It’s been terrible. I called up President Macron and I extended our sympathies and best wishes, but they had terrible terrorist attacks over the last few days, and more than one.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","54:02"
"Donald Trump","I suspended the entry of foreign refugees from terror afflicted nations. If you don’t mind, I don’t think … Biden has pledged a staggering 700% increase in the manifesto that he agreed to with … I call it the manifesto because that’s what it is, with crazy Bernie Sanders. He’s a crazy guy. Mike, this guy is one of the greatest loses, Bernie Sanders. He loses with Hillary. He goes back to voting. He loses again. Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren, all she had to do … no. All she had to do was get out two weeks earlier. He would have won … Bernie would have won everything. Similar ideology, not a good one, but similar. But Bernie goes back and he’s supporting now Joe. I don’t know. He’s a great sport. He’s a great loser.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","55:06"
"Donald Trump","Mike wouldn’t be doing that. Mike would be ripping people apart, wouldn’t you, Mike? 700% increase. Think of that. He wants a seven … they’ve agreed to it. Not once. They’ve agreed to it with AOC plus 3. You know what that is? AOC plus 3. One of the three is in Ilhan Omar. That’s we’re going to win Minnesota.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","55:57"

Do I have your approval? I think so. I think so.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","56:20"
"Donald Trump","He vowed to terminate our travel bans on jihadist regions. In other words, “Come on in, everybody. Enjoy the United States. We love you very much.” Biden will open the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism and I am keeping the terrorists the hell out of our country, If you don’t mind. If you don’t mind. We invested $2.5 trillion in the United States military, the biggest investment ever made. Our military was totally depleted when I took over, right? It was depleted. Our planes were old, our jet fighters. They used to go to the desert, the graveyards, airplane graveyards, to take parts out of old planes and bring them in. Now we have brand new F35 fighter jets and tankers and submarines and missiles and rockets, and our nuclear has been fixed to a level that you wouldn’t believe, and we have the super-duper missiles that go very quickly.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","56:38"
"Donald Trump","We were very, very … hypersonic, they call them, right? Hypersonic. They go rather quickly, seven times the speed of our fastest missile right now. The best in the world. We saved the Philly shipyard and Biden shut it down. Biden shut it down. We also passed VA Choice and VA Accountability for our veterans and we just got a 91% approval rating and he’s got a 91% approval rating as a great catcher. He might have higher than that. Hey, you might be 99%. We killed the leader of ISIS, Al-Baghdadi. We took out the mass murder of U.S. troops and many troops all over the world. Soleimani is dead. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal. “Here’s a $150 billion. Make a short term deal. It’s almost expired.” If I didn’t terminate it, it would have been … it’s getting close to expiring. Short-term deal, basically. Countries, not like you’re leasing a store. It’s a country. Made a short term deal. $150 billion and 1.8 billion in cash. You ever see 1.8 billion in cash?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","57:43"
"Donald Trump","I recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem and presidents have wanted to do that for many, many, many decades and they never had the guts to do it. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. They’d been working on that for 52 years. I did it in two hours. It took two hours. Instead of endless war, we are forging peace in the Middle East. You see what’s happening? That coming in? No blood in the sand. Did it the opposite way. I said, “How have they done it?” And I said, “Good. Let’s do it the opposite way.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","58:59"

"Donald Trump","That’s very nice. So I’ve been nominated for … Now I hear it’s four. Nominated. But think of it and not just the Middle East. So we had a case, we’re making trade deals with Kosovo and Serbia. Kosovo, Serbia.. They’ve been killing each other for decades. They fight. That’s what they do. They kill each other, so many years. So we’re doing one deal, another deal, and they come in and tell me they’re doing a deal with Kosovo, deal with Serbia. I said, “Wait a minute. They’ve been killing each other for decades and decades. I don’t want to do the deal. Tell them I’m not doing the deal unless they make peace. They have to come in and make economic peace. They have to make peace. They don’t have to kill each other.” I’m saving lives. You could say, “What does that have to do with us?”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","59:36"
"Donald Trump","You know how long it took me? About three minutes. I said to my guys, I said, “Tell them I’m not …” They want to make a deal. Everyone wants to do with us. Everyone now, especially, but everyone wants to do with us. So I went to them, I said, “No, tell them they got to stop killing each other. And good people. Good here, good there. Stop killing them.” You know what? Within a short period of time, we made a deal, right? That way we were nominated for a Nobel peace prize. I said, “That one took me about 15 minutes.” We made a deal and the leaders came into the Oval Office and they were hugging and kissing and they was so happy with each other. I said, “isn’t that nice?” So smart. You say, “Hey, we’re making deals. Let’s tell them they got to get along.” And it was great and a lot of people … we saved a lot of lives and you know what? Cost us nothing. It didn’t do anything.

"Donald Trump","So we got that little … but they won’t give [inaudible 01:01:27]. They won’t give it. They just probably talk. But I hear it’s an extraordinarily left organization, but if they do … Somebody said, “You definitely deserve them,” and that’s true. Obama got one. Remember? He had no idea why. He got elected president, immediately after his election, “We have nominated you for a peace prize,” and it was a massive story. When I got nominated, I got nominated for peace in the Middle Eastern, right? I said to my wife, you heard this story. I said, “Darling, I’m going to come home a little early tonight. I’m going to watch the news. We have big news today. I’m going to get the greatest publicity you’ve ever seen, darling.” She said, “What happened?” I said, “Well, it’s peace in the Middle East. I got a Nobel peace prize nomination. This is going to be really something, darling.” I turned on the fake news.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","01:01:24"
"Donald Trump","They talked about a hurricane and they talked about a couple of fires where they should manage their forest much better and you wouldn’t have to … All you have to do manage your fires, you won’t have any fires. Right? Then they talked about a couple of other things and they talked about this and that, and after about 15 minutes, the first 15 minutes, it was a half an hour show, free airways from the government, even though it’s fake news. I don’t know. We have to look at that. Right? But think of it. Look, the cameras are shaking now.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","01:02:14"
"Donald Trump","So 15 minutes go by. No mention. Now when Obama got his for no reason, he still doesn’t know why he got it. He’s walking around, “Why did I get it?” No, it was the biggest story. I remember it now. He was nominated. The guy didn’t even do it. He just got to the office. So 15 minutes go by, there’s nothing. It’s a little embarrassing. I have our great First Lady there. I’m trying to show off. Right? Right? You understand that, Mike. It’s a little embarrassing. Now we go into the second 15. She said, “Darling, I don’t think they’re going to mention it,” because they started talking about something for kids, something kids should do in the spring. I said, “I don’t think they’re going to mention it darling.” Then the next day or the next week I got another one and another one but this time we didn’t go back home to watch. Too busy. So it’s one of those things, right? I’ve done more in 47 months, then sleepy Joe Biden has done in 47 years.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-reading-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Reading, PA October 31","01:02:43"
"Donald Trump","A vote for Republicans is a vote for the American dream, and remember Abraham Lincoln, the great Abraham Lincoln, was a Republican. Please remember that. Abraham Lincoln, over the last … long period of time, we’ve done a job. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China. It’s already started. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. Right? We will defend the right to life, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will defend your second amendment. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. That’s what we’re doing. Bring them all in. We will end surprise medical billing, which is a disaster, require price transparency, already signed, and that’s bigger than healthcare. You watch. Already signed.

"Donald Trump","Can you imagine this goes into effect, so hard to get, and we have Biden as a president? They’ll say, “What a job he’s done. What a job he’s done.” And they go to him, “Sir, you’ve done a great job on transparency.” He says, “What is that?” I did it. I said to my people, “You have to start in January 1st?” But because of statutory provisions, et cetera, so it’s January 1st. You remember what I said, price transparency, bigger than healthcare. Wait until you see what I’m talking about. Lower drug prices even more than we already have, but it’s going to be favored nations. We have the highest prices in the world and we now will match the lowest prices of the world. The drug companies hate me. They don’t like me.

They all want me out, but here we are, right? Here we are. We will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Remember that. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. That’s where we’re going. NASA, again, is the great space center of the world. It was closed and in disrepair when I took over. Now it’s the hottest place there is to space, and we get all these rich guys, right?

For generations America’s destiny was made, forged, and won in places like Bethlehem, Bristol, Allentown, Altoona, Scranton, and Redding, all names we all know for a long time. Our American ancestors gave their blood, sweat and tears to defend our country and to defend our freedom.
