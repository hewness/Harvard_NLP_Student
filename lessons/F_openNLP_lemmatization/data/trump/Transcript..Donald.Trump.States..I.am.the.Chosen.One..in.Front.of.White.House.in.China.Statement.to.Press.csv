"Donald Trump","Over the last five or six years, China’s made $500-billion. 500-billion. Ripped it out of the United States. And not only that, if you take a look, intellectual property theft, add that to it and add a lot of other things to it. So, somebody… Excuse me. Somebody had to do it. I am the chosen one. Somebody had to do it. So, I’m taking on China. I’m taking it on China on trade. And you know what? We’re winning because we’re the piggy bank. We’re the one that all these countries, including the European union, wants to rob and takes advantage of. But I’d need a letter from the attorney general","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-states-i-am-the-chosen-one-in-front-of-white-house-in-china-statement-to-press","Transcript: Donald Trump States ""I am the Chosen One"" in Front of White House in China Statement to Press","00:00"
"Speaker 2","Mr. President. Taking America into a recession, is it worth it? And do Americans need to back that up?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-states-i-am-the-chosen-one-in-front-of-white-house-in-china-statement-to-press","Transcript: Donald Trump States ""I am the Chosen One"" in Front of White House in China Statement to Press","00:47"
"Donald Trump","So, the fake news of which many of you are members is trying to convince the public to have a recession. Let’s have a recession. The United States is doing phenomenally well, but one thing I have to do is economically take on China because China has been ripping us off for many years. President Clinton, President Bush, and President Obama and others should have done this long before me. My life would be much easier… Although I enjoy doing it, but my life would be much easier if I just said, “Let China continue to rip off the United States.” All right? It’d be much easier, but I can’t do that. We are winning against China. They’ve lost two and a half million jobs in a very short period of time. They want to make a deal. It’s got to be a deal that’s good for the United States where they want to make it deal. Probably, we will make a deal. But if I didn’t do that, and I’m not doing… Somebody said it’s Trump’s trade war. This isn’t my trade war. This is a trade war that should have taken place a long time ago by a lot of other presidents.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-states-i-am-the-chosen-one-in-front-of-white-house-in-china-statement-to-press","Transcript: Donald Trump States ""I am the Chosen One"" in Front of White House in China Statement to Press","00:52"

"Donald Trump","Sorry. I was put here by people to do a great job and that’s what I’m doing. And nobody’s done a job like I’ve done. Now, would China rather wait for a little more than a year and try and get sleepy Joe Biden to negotiate with instead of President Trump? Maybe, but I don’t think so. You know why? They’re losing too many jobs too fast. They had the worst year in 27 years, but I think it was actually 52 or 54 years. It was the worst year they’ve had in a half a century, and that’s because of me. And I’m not proud of that. But you know what? They want to negotiate, sleepy Joe doesn’t have a clue. Sleepy Joe said, “Oh, China’s wonderful.” Well, China is wonderful for China, but I’m wonderful for the USA.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-states-i-am-the-chosen-one-in-front-of-white-house-in-china-statement-to-press","Transcript: Donald Trump States ""I am the Chosen One"" in Front of White House in China Statement to Press","02:43"
