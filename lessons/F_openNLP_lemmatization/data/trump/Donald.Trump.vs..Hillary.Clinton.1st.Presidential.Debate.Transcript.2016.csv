"Lester Holt","Good evening, from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. I’m Lester Holt, anchor of NBC Nightly News. I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate. The participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan nonprofit organization. The commission drafted tonight’s format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns. The 90 minute debate is divided into six segments, each 50 minutes long. We’ll explore three topic areas tonight, achieving prosperity, America’s direction, and securing America. At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead off question to both candidates and they will each have up to two minutes to respond. From that point until the end of the segment, we’ll have an open discussion. The questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns. The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying. We’ll invite you to applaud. However, at this moment, as we walk on the candidates, Democratic nominee for President of the United States, Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee for President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","00:07"

"Lester Holt","[inaudible 00:01:48] Good luck to you. Well, I don’t expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight. But I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled. We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important. And we’re going to press for specifics. I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates. And just as important to the American people. Candidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values. So let’s begin. We’re calling this opening segment, achieving prosperity and central to that is jobs. There are two economic realities in America today. There’s been a record, six straight years of job growth and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation, however, income inequality remains significant and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton. Why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American workers?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:48"
"Hillary Clinton","Thank you, Lester and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us. The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we’ll build together. Today is my granddaughter’s second birthday so I think about this a lot. First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means we need new jobs, good jobs with rising incomes. I want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs and infrastructure in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women’s work. I also want to see more companies do profit sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","02:51"
"Hillary Clinton","And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work. I’ve heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you’re under. So let’s have paid family leave, earned sick days. Let’s be sure we have affordable childcare and debt-free college. How are we going to do it? We’re going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes. Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it’s good to be with you. We’re going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country. You have to judge us. Who can shoulder the immense awesome responsibilities of the presidency? Who can put into action the plans that will make your life better? I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","03:56"
"Lester Holt","Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, the same question to you. It’s about putting money, more money, into the pockets of American workers. You have up to two minutes.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","04:55"
"Donald Trump","Thank you. Lester. Our jobs are fleeing the country. They’re going to Mexico. They’re going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. They’re devaluing their currency and there’s nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight and we have a winning fight, because they’re using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China and many other countries are doing the same thing. So we’re losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at what’s happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said, it’s the eighth wonder of the world, that building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much. So Ford is leaving. You see that. Their small car division leaving, thousands of jobs. Leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio, they’re all leaving, and we can’t allow it to happen anymore.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","05:02"
"Donald Trump","As far as childcare is concerned. And so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we’re going to do, but perhaps we’ll be talking about that later. But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and with it firing all of their people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier Air Conditioning in Indianapolis, they fired 1400 people. They’re going to Mexico. So many, hundreds and hundreds, of companies are doing this. We can not let it happen.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","05:59"
"Donald Trump","Under my plan, I’ll be reducing taxes tremendously from 35% to 15% for companies, small and big businesses, that’s going to be a job creator like we haven’t seen since Ronald Reagan, it’s going to be a beautiful thing to watch. Companies will come. They will build, they will expand. New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","06:39"
"Lester Holt","Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","07:11"
"Hillary Clinton","Well, I think that trade is an important issue. Of course, we are 5% of the world’s population. We have to trade with the other 95% and we need to have smart, fair trade deals. We also though need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions and the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle down economics all over again. In fact, it would be the most extreme version. The biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we’ve ever had. I call it trumped up, trickle down because that’s exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy. We just have a different view about what’s best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes. I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","07:13"
"Hillary Clinton","I understand that. Donald was very fortunate in his life and that’s all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people the better off we’ll be and that everything will work out from there. I don’t buy that. I have a different experience. My father was a small businessman. He worked really hard. He printed drapery fabrics on long tables where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silk screen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going. And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle-class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we’ll grow. That’s the kind of economy I want us to see again.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","08:06"
"Lester Holt","Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if I can. You’ve talked about creating 25 million jobs and you’ve promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans. How are we going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas? How specifically are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","08:56"
"Donald Trump","Well, for one thing, and before we start on that, my father gave me a very small loan in 1975. And I built it into a company that’s worth many, many billions of dollars with some of the greatest assets in the world. And I say that only because that’s the kind of thinking that our country needs. Our country’s in deep trouble. We don’t know what we’re doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China, they’re the best, the best ever, at it. What they’re doing to us is a very, very sad thing. So we have to do that. We have to renegotiate our trade deals. And Lester, they’re taking our jobs. They’re giving incentives. They’re doing things that frankly we don’t do.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","09:13"
"Donald Trump","Let me give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax. We’re on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, there’s a tax. When they sell an automatic 16%, approximately. When they sell into us, there’s no tax. It’s a defective agreement. It’s been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven’t done anything about it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","09:52"
"Donald Trump","Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, I guess. Is that okay? Good. I want you to be very happy. It’s very important to me. But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently, she’s been doing this for 30 years and why hasn’t she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective, just because of the tax and many other reasons. But just because of the tax.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","10:13"

"Donald Trump","Secretary Clinton and others, politicians should have been doing this for years. Not right now because of the fact that we’ve created a movement, they should have been doing this for years. What’s happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is look, we owe $20 trillion. We cannot do it any longer, Lester.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","10:39"
"Lester Holt","Back to the question though, how do you bring back specifically, bring back jobs? American manufacturers, how do you make them bring the jobs back?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","11:02"
"Donald Trump","Well, the first thing you do is don’t let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them, they’re leaving and they’re leaving in bigger numbers than ever. And what you do is you say fine. You want to go to Mexico with some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck. But if you think you’re going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you’re wrong. And once you say you’re going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave because in many cases they own the companies. So what I’m saying is we can stop them from leaving. We have to stop them from leaving. And that’s a big, big factor.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","11:09"

"Hillary Clinton","Well, let’s stop for a second. And remember where we were eight years ago, we had the worst financial crisis, the great recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street and created a perfect storm. In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said back in 2006, “Gee, I hope it does collapse because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.” Well, it did collapse.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","11:54"

"Hillary Clinton","9 million people, 9 million people lost their jobs. Five million people lost their homes. And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out. Now we have come back from that abyss and it has not been easy. So we’re now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy. But the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place. Independent experts have looked at what I’ve proposed and looked at what Donald’s proposed. And basically they’ve said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would, in some instances, disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy were to go into effect, we would lose three and a half million jobs and maybe have another recession. They’ve looked at my plans and they’ve said, “Okay, if we can do this,” and I intend to get it done, “we will have 10 million more new jobs,” because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy. Take clean energy. Some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it’s real.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","12:34"

"Hillary Clinton","I think it’s important that we grip this and deal with it both at home and abroad. And here’s what we can do. We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. That’s a lot of jobs. That’s a lot of new economic activity. So I’ve tried to be very specific about what we can and should do. And I am determined that we’re going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we’ve made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","13:58"

"Donald Trump","She talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company, our country, that was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one. Now look, I’m a great believer in all forms of energy, but we’re putting a lot of people out of work. Our energy policies are a disaster. Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. You can’t do what you’re looking to do with 20 trillion in debt.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","14:33"
"Donald Trump","The Obama administration, from the time they’ve come in, is over 230 years worth of debt. And he’s topped it. He’s doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven and a half years to be semi exact. So I will tell you this, we have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs. And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentive to build new companies or to expand because they’re not doing it. And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving. They’re gone. And Hillary, I just ask you this, you’ve been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now? For 30 years you’ve been doing it and now you’re just starting to think of solutions. [crosstalk 00:15:53] I will bring, excuse me, I will bring back jobs.

When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me and I held them all to the same test. Will they create jobs in America? Will they raise incomes in America? And are they good for our national security? Some of them, I voted for. The biggest one, a multi-national one known as CAFTA, I voted against. And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals, but let’s not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy. I think it is a part of it. And I’ve said what I’m going to do. I’m going to have a special prosecutor. We’re going to enforce the trade deals we have. And we’re going to hold people accountable. When I was Secretary of State, we actually increased American exports globally, 30%. We increased them to China, 50%.

And the financial disclosure statement, they don’t give you the tax rate. They don’t give you all the details that tax returns would.

The other thing. I’m extremely under leveraged. The report that said 650, which by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business said, “Boy, that’s really not a lot of money.” It’s not a lot of money relative to what I had. The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was actually, it wasn’t even a bad story, to be honest with you.

Much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police, as we’ve seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa. Race has been a big issue in this campaign.

The vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids. There’s a lot that we should be proud of, and we should be supporting and lifting up. But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe. There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective. Stop and frisk was found to be unconstitutional.

"Hillary Clinton","Because it was ineffective. It did not do what it needed to do. Now, I believe in community policing, and in fact, violent crime is one half of what it was in 1991. Property crime is down 40%. We just don’t want to see it creep back up. We’ve had 25 years of very good cooperation, but there were some problems, some unintended consequences. Too many young African American and Latino men ended up in jail for non-violent offenses. And it’s just a fact that if you’re a young African American man, and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated.

We need to have more second chance programs. I’m glad that we’re ending private prisons in the federal system. I want to see them ended in the state system.

But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","50:26"
"Hillary Clinton","I’ve met with a group of very distinguished experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago. They admit it’s an issue. They’ve got a lot of concerns. Mental health is one of the biggest concerns because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street. They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance. And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","51:04"

"Donald Trump","First of all, I agree. And a lot of people, even within my own party, want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no fly lists. I agree with you. When a person is on a watch list or a no fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I’m very proud of. These are very, very good people, and they’re protecting the Second Amendment, but I think we have to look very strongly at no fly lists and watch lists. And when people are on there, even if they shouldn’t be on there, we’ll help them. We’ll help them legally. We’ll help them get off. But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","51:33"

I really don’t think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth. I think maybe there’s a political reason why you can’t say it, but I really don’t believe. In New York City, stop and frisk, we had 2,200 murders and stop and frisk brought it down to 500 murders. 500 murder’s a lot of murders, hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good? But we went from 2,200 to 500 and it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg. It was terminated by our current mayor, but stop and frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City, tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did.

Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and very close friend of Secretary Clinton and her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard and you can go look it up and you can check it out. And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened. Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it. They were pressing it very hard. She failed to get the birth certificate. When I got involved, I didn’t fail. I got him to give the birth certificate. So I’m satisfied with it.

But I was the one that got them to produce the birth certificate, and I think I did a good job. Secretary Clinton also fought it. Now everybody in mainstream’s going to say, “Oh, that’s not true.” Look, it’s true. Sidney Blumenthal sent the reporter.

"Hillary Clinton","Well, just listen to what you heard. And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions. So he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed, but it can’t be dismissed that easily. He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen. There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted. He persisted year after year because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","58:43"

"Donald Trump","I’d love to respond. First of all, I got to watch, in preparing for this, some of your debates against Barack Obama. You treated him with terrible disrespect. And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. Doesn’t work that way. You were after him. You even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures. I don’t think you can deny that. But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true. So when you try to act holier than thou, it really doesn’t work. It really does.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:00:47"
"Donald Trump","Now, as far as the lawsuit. Yes, when I was very young, I went into my father’s company. He had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we along with many, many other companies throughout the country, it was a federal lawsuit, were sued. We settled the suit with zero, with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do, but they sued many people. I noticed you bring that up a lot. And I also noticed the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don’t do on you. Maybe I’m trying to save the money, but frankly, I look at that and I say, “Isn’t that amazing?” Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms.

In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African Americans, against Muslims, against anybody, and it’s a tremendously successful club. I’m so glad I did it, and I have been given great credit for what I did.

"Hillary Clinton","Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare, will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president because clearly we’re facing at this point, two different kinds of adversaries.

"Hillary Clinton","But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states. The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia. There’s no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country. And I am deeply concerned about this. I know Donald’s praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really tough, long game here. And one of the things he’s done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee. And we’ve recently have learned that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:03:25"

And we’re going to have to make it clear that we don’t want to use the kinds of tools that we have. We don’t want to engage in a different kind of warfare, but we will defend the citizens of this country. And the Russians need to understand that. I think they’ve been treating it as almost a probing. How far would we go? How much will we do? And that’s why I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans. That that is just unacceptable.

I don’t think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. She’s saying Russia, Russia, Russia. Maybe it was, I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds. You don’t know who broke in to DNC, but what did we learn with DNC? We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Look what happened to her. But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of.

We don’t know because the truth is, under President Obama, we’ve lost control of things that we used to have control over. We came in with the internet.

"Hillary Clinton","Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing. I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS. It does involve going after them online. I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere. But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa and their claim of being a caliphate. We’re making progress.

"Hillary Clinton","But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they’ve had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons. So we have to make this the top priority. And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership. I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaeda leadership when I was Secretary of State, including of course taking out Bin Ladin. And I think we need to go after Baghdadi as well, make that one of our organizing principles, because we’ve got to defeat ISIS, and we’ve got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:08:59"
"Lester Holt","You mentioned ISIS and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando.

"Donald Trump","Well, first, I have to say one thing, very important. Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS. We will take out ISIS. Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out.They shouldn’t have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster and ISIS was formed.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:10:05"
"Donald Trump","So she talks about taking them out. She’s been doing it a long time. She’s been trying to take them out for a long time, but they wouldn’t have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldn’t have had them, or as I’ve been saying for a long time, and I think you’ll agree because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil, and we should have taken the oil, ISIS would not have been able to form either because the oil was their primary source of income. And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil, a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:10:27"

But the larger point, he says this constantly, is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama. And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then Iraqi government that would have protected our troops.

We’re working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations. Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community. They’re on the front lines. They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else. They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald’s rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:12:38"

You started the Iran deal, that’s another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall.

And I said, “Well, I’ll tell you, I haven’t given lots of thought to NATO, but two things. Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren’t paying their fair share,” and that bothers me because we should be asked… We’re defending them and they should at least be paying us what they’re supposed to be paying by treaty and contract. And number two, I said and very strongly, “NATO could be obsolete,” and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times to be honest.

"Hillary Clinton","Okay. Let’s talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald. First, NATO. NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this, an attack on one is an attack on all. And do you know the only time it’s ever been invoked? After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:19:06"
"Hillary Clinton","With respect to Iran, when I became Secretary of State, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb. They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration. They had built covert facilities. They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away. And we had sanctioned them. I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn’t enough.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:19:47"
"Hillary Clinton","So I spent a year and a half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China, to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran, and we did drive them to the negotiating table.

"Donald Trump","Well, I have to say that for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she’s very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. But Russia has been expanding, They have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint. I looked the other night, I was seeing B52s. They’re old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them. We are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do for a strike. I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it’s over.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:23:51"
"Donald Trump","At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can’t take anything off the table, because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we’re doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea. And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I’ve ever seen negotiated, that you started, is the Iran deal. Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. Iran has power over North Korea. And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should have done something with respect to Yemen, and all these other places.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:24:31"
"Donald Trump","And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn’t you do that? Why didn’t you do add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash, nobody’s ever seen that before, that turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1.7 billion in cash. Obviously, I guess, for the hostages. It certainly looks that way.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:25:13"
"Donald Trump","So you say to yourself, why didn’t they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems. All they have to do is sit back 10 years and they don’t have to do much.

"Hillary Clinton","Well, let me start by saying words matter, words matter when you run for president and they really matter when you are president. I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere, that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them. It is essential that America’s word be good. And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and some worries on the part of many leaders across the globe. I’ve talked with a number of them. But I want to on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people say that, our word is good.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:26:05"
"Hillary Clinton","It’s also important that we look at the entire global situation. There is no doubt that we have other problems with Iran, but personally I’d rather deal with the other problems, having put that lid on their nuclear program, than still to be facing that. And Donald never tells you what he would do. Would he have started a war? Would he have bombed Iran? If he’s going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be. But it’s like his plan to defeat ISIS. He says, it’s a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:26:51"
"Hillary Clinton","We need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues. People around the world follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do. Can they rely on us? Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values? That’s what I intend to do. I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they’re abroad or at home. We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security, to be given any opportunities at all.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-1st-presidential-debate-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:27:38"
