"Donald Trump","Thank you very much, Allentown. Thank you very much, Allentown. I know it well. Eight days, you believe that? Eight days from now, we’re going to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and we are going to win four more great years in the White House. I want to begin today by discussing an issue of existential importance to Pennsylvania. Very, very important. Last week, sleepy Joe Biden made perhaps the most shocking admission ever uttered in the history of presidential debates. In other words, he blew it on live television. 91 to nine, did you see that? 91. And you know what that means? 91 to nine, but we won’t talk about that [inaudible 00:01:53] fake news.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","00:58"
"Donald Trump","Joe Biden confirmed his plan to abolish the entire US oil industry. That means no fracking, no jobs, no energy for Pennsylvania families, Texas, all the other [crosstalk 00:02:08]. He wants to go wind, let’s go wind. Let’s go have brownouts and blackouts all over Pennsylvania, all over the country. He wants to go wind, he wants to go with windmills that are made in Germany and China and send big, big carbon into the air when they’re making them, you know that, right? From a different continent, but that’s okay.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","01:57"
"Donald Trump","Biden’s plan is an economic death sentence for Pennsylvania’s energy sector. I mean, I think you all know that. Did you see it though? Do you believe it? And even the anchor, who I thought did a very good job, by the way, Kristin, I thought she did a very good job. She said, “Why do you say that?” Do you remember that? “Why are you saying that? Why do you say that?” He will eradicate your energy and send Pennsylvania into a crippling depression. Somehow, that doesn’t sound good, Mr. Congressman [inaudible 00:03:04]. The Biden energy shut down, and he wants to shut down the whole country and we’re rounding the turn. All they want to talk about is COVID. By the way, on November 4th, you won’t be hearing so much about it. COVID, COVID, COVID. COVID! Today, let’s talk about COVID. All over Europe. Europe’s spike, they don’t talk about that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","02:32"
"Donald Trump","Now we’re rounding the turn and we have the vaccines coming out very soon, years ahead of schedule. If he would have done it, like he did the H1N1 swine flu, one of the worst handled, that was an epidemic. It was a disaster, he had no idea what the hell he was doing, but you know that. The Biden energy shutdown would inflict deep pain and misery on Pennsylvania, mass layoffs, constant blackouts and brownouts, soaring gas prices. Nice to have that $2 gasoline, isn’t it? Surging energy bills, no air conditioning in the summer, no heat during the winter, and no electricity during peak hours. “Let’s watch President Trump on television. I’m sorry. We won’t be able to do it. The wind isn’t blowing today, darling, we won’t be able.” No, it doesn’t power those big factories that were opening up all over the country.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","03:26"
"Donald Trump","Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris. Did you see her last night on television with the laugh? She was laughing at a horrible question about her and she just laughed, she found it so funny. She’s the most liberal Senator by far. She’s most liberal than crazy Bernie. Even sponsored the $100 trillion Green New Deal. The Green New Deal. I don’t think so. The Green New Deal would be an economic disaster for our nation. Certainly for this state. Biden and Harris have a pledge to join and rejoin the Paris… Look, do you know about Paris? The Paris Climate Accord. One of the great disasters of all time. Just call up France, “How’s Paris doing?” Shipping your energy jobs to foreign polluters all over China, all over the rest of the world. And it was hard bringing them back, we brought our jobs back. A lot of our jobs are coming back now. They’re coming back now. Speaking about jobs, I want to thank the people that own this plant. You have a governor named Tom Wolf, I guess, Tom Wolf. This thing was set up just a few hours ago, that’s why it’s so incredible that people across the street, trying to get in. This was set up because your governor made it almost impossible for us to find any site. Normally we would have had an airport, we would’ve gotten in, we would have had a… I mean, this is really a nice place. No, I want to thank the trucking company, they’re great, they’re supporters. Well, we just found it a little while ago because they were shut out. We had a deal, it was a deal and they broke the deal, headed by governor Tom Wolf, who’s got your whole Commonwealth shut down. Whole Commonwealth is shut down. Although probably on November 4th, it’ll open. They’ll announce it November 4th. Did you see the one governor said, “No, I think we should be open by around November 4th.” Thank you, [inaudible 00:06:36]. No, they think they’re going to inflict harm in bad numbers, our numbers are so good, our comeback numbers are the best anywhere in the world. Doesn’t matter. But you know what, it does inflict tremendous harm on the people that are shut out of their jobs, that are going to lose their jobs with suicides and drugs and alcohol and all the problems. So Tom Wolf, next time, give us a little notice governor. And I’ll remember it, Tom, I’m going to remember it, Tom. “Hello, Mr. President, this is Governor Wolf. I need help. I need help.” You know what, these people are bad. We go out of our way, regardless, Republican, Democrat, when they have a problem, but he shut us out and he tried shutting us out of two other venues. We have three of these today in Pennsylvania. Three of these. And these just came out. I have to say, because I watch… In the fake news, there has never been anything like what’s happening now. But these just came out, so Rasmussen just came out, “Trump is leading.” That’s been one of the most accurate [inaudible 00:00:07:49]. You don’t read it. In fact, a pollster called us yesterday, said, “You have really good numbers.” But they won’t accept them, when we put them out, they don’t put them out. Unless they’re negative, the press doesn’t put them out. This is serious. And how about big tech? How about the Biden scandal? And they’re not even covering it. They don’t want to talk about. And by the way, that’s a real scandal. And the press doesn’t want to write about it, except for the New York Post, the press won’t write about it and big tech won’t take it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","04:21"
"Speaker 1","Lock him up!","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","08:26"
"Donald Trump","People have no idea what’s going to happen in Pennsylvania, that I can tell you. I know Pennsylvania. Don’t forget, I went to school in Pennsylvania. I went to school in Pennsylvania. College and I know it much better than he does. He’s always talking about, “I grew up in Pennsylvania.” He grew up nowhere. He didn’t grow up. No, did you watch him on 60 Minutes last night? Did you see yesterday when he called me George? No, I don’t know if I like George. No, not George. What a mess. No, he called me George. I don’t know if I should be insulted or happy about it. I’m sort of insulted that’s the first time that’s happened to me in a long time. Now, but the polls just came out. So it just came out. So let me tell you the real polls, okay. Because we feel we’re winning almost easily, but you don’t hear that. I watched television today, purposely to see what was going on. So it started… CNN is the worst. But I hear the guy… I hear AT&T is finally getting smart, and they’re going to fire the head of CNN. That’s what I hear. [crosstalk 00:09:55]. That’s what I hear. Zucker. But you know what? Look at this. So Rasmussen was very accurate last time, one of the top two or three. Rasmussen, “Trump approval rating, 53 and 52.” 53%.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","08:37"
"Donald Trump","So in another poll, we’re leading in Nevada. That’s nice. We’re, one up in Nevada, we’re way up in Texas, despite what you keep hearing. Five up in Texas. I think we’re much more than that if you listen to the Governor of Texas, who’s Greg. In Ohio, we’re way up. By four or five points, five points. In Florida, we have it down as four up in Florida, that’s a lot for Florida. So in Florida, Rasmussen, that’s a Rasmussen but these are all different. That’s a Rasmussen. 50 to 46, we’re plus four in Florida. You don’t hear these numbers, right? You hear these guys get on television, “Florida is going to be very tough.” No, we’re winning in Florida. We have crowds. We’re winning in Florida. But you don’t hear it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","10:18"
"Donald Trump","We’re nicely up, five up in Georgia, Landmark. It’s called Landmark. Five up in Georgia. You don’t hear that. I heard today, “He’s losing in…” No, we’re not losing in Georgia, we’re going to win by much more than five. In Arizona were nicely up, really nicely up. Very good. We’re winning big in Iowa, but we should be with what I do for the farmers. Got them $28 million from China. In Montana, we’re so far up, they shouldn’t even have the election. Likewise, in Utah, so far up. We’re plus 12, plus 15. And in West Virginia, we’re 20 up, 20 points up.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","11:07"
"Donald Trump","These just came out. They came out today. And then at a head to head with sleepy Joe Biden on a national basis, I am really into the states, because you know you run… Remember Hillary used to complain, but I never did a national. Winning, I think winning the overall vote is almost easier than the electoral college. But you remember last year, she’d complain. She used to campaign in the wrong states. The year… But they probably learned, but in the national poll were leading against sleepy Joe Biden, we’re leading. And that’s a Rasmussen poll. Head to head. No, we’re leading head to head against sleepy Joe. So I just thought I’d do that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","11:59"
"Donald Trump","Remember in the old days, four years ago, I used to read the polls. I’d drive them crazy and they’d say, “Oh, that’s not right.” I turned out to be right. So I want you to hear it. I saw on television now, it’s the only way we get it on because they don’t put it on, they’re fake and they’re corrupt people. They’re fake. They’re corrupt. I mean, I never watched CNN, but I had to see it this morning to see. So I watched them for a little while, I watched MSDNC, owned by Comcast. MSDNC. And you watch these polls and you say, “Oh, this is terrible.” They’re fake polls. They’re fake. They’re total fake. These are real polls.We’re going to win in Florida. We’re going to win in Pennsylvania, I think. I mean, look at this venue, you have thousands of people across the street that couldn’t get in. They couldn’t get in, because honestly, secret service wasn’t that well equipped. They didn’t expect… Because we just set this place up. We just set it up, and think of it. So we have a venue and the governor that counts the ballots… The governor count the ballots, and we’re watching you, governor, very closely in Philadelphia. We’re watching you. A lot of bad things happen there with the counting of the votes. We’re watching you Governor Wolf, very closely, we’re watching you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","12:40"
"Donald Trump","But the same guy that makes it impossible for us to get a venue, we just got this thing literally hours ago. And to have people across the street trying to get in is amazing. I mean, it’s amazing. Which tells you, and I don’t know if you saw the Ohio route, we had 35, 40,000 people. Thank you very much.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","14:10"

"Donald Trump","Thank you! Now, one of them a guest this morning. I really watched it for this reason. I mean, I had a good look. It started off, “COVID, COVID, COVID. Don’t go and vote. Don’t go and vote.” You know who’s not voting? The Democrats, they’re not voting. If you look at some of these early polls, so we’re supposed to be way down in the initial week because it’s the fake ballots, right? The phony ballots that are all crooked as hell. And then we catch up, but we have states we’re were leading in early voting. That’s trouble because we win everything from here on in. We win everything. Just get out there and vote, or if you have an absentee, send it in. But you know what, there’s nothing like getting out and voting. And I did it two days ago. I went and voted. And it was so good.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","14:51"
"Donald Trump","I went in Florida, at Palm beach I said, “Okay, I’m here to vote.” And the woman was fantastic, “Sir, do you have identification?” I said, “Just happen to have my passport.” “Sir, do you have any additional identification?” “I do. I do.” She says, “Thank you.” And she was good. I mean, “She was doing what you have to do. She was good. She was totally good.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","15:37"

"Donald Trump","I hear this guy back here. So, she did a great job. And you know what, it was a beautiful thing. Because there’s no way you can cheat. I mean that, then they said, “Here, do this. And here, sir, you can…” They give you a booth, you sit down, you do what you have to do. You get up, they fold it, they put it in. Then you put it in the machine yourself. They don’t want to touch it. It was so professional. There’s no way you can cheat with these ballots. Who’s sending them, who’s receiving them, who’s bringing them back, who’s signing them. It’s ridiculous. It’s the only way we can lose, in my opinion, is massive fraud.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","16:06"
"Donald Trump","And that’s what’s happening because all over the country, you’re seeing it. Thousands and thousands of ballots. How about the military ballots that were thrown into a garbage can with the name Trump on it? So all we can say is law enforcement is watching Nevada, it’s watching Philadelphia, and Pennsylvania, by the way, but Philadelphia in particular, because they had a lot of strange things happen over the years in Philadelphia. And we’re watching your Philadelphia and we’re watching at the highest level.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","16:46"
"Donald Trump","And we’re watching the Democrat governor who’s got his state shut down, a great state, North Carolina, he’s got it shut down. We’re watching North Carolina. We’re watching Michigan. Oh, that’s another one, we’re leading by two points in Michigan. Hadn’t been won in decades until I won it four years ago. We’re leading in Michigan, and we should be, I brought a lot of car business in, brought a lot of car plants in. They hadn’t had a plant built in 42 years or something, and we brought a lot of plants in. You hear that jet? You hear them? That’s a brand new, beautiful F-35 jet.

"Donald Trump","Joe Biden is a diehard globalist who wiped out your steel mills. You know it better than almost any place in this country. Closed down your factories, killed your coal jobs, outsourced your industries and supported every terrible and disastrous trade deal for the whole… I mean, for 47 years this guy’s been there. You saw in the debate, did anybody watch the debate by any chance? Did you see? My standard answer, “Joe, you’ve been there for 47 years, what did you do? And you left three and a half years ago, Joe, so it’s not like it was 25 years ago. You left. Why didn’t you do it, Joe?”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","18:08"
"Donald Trump","He’s talking about, “Oh, I would have done this with the pandemic.” And yet he had the worst… His Chief of Staff said that he, and himself, the Chief, they were grossly incompetent. They had no idea what to do. And now they’re telling us how to handle a much more lethal problem. Amazing. I wonder if that Chief of Staff is still around? He probably said it when he assumed Joe couldn’t win. When Joe ran, because he was always 1% Joe, we used to call him 1% Joe, and then he ran and now he’s at 50%. You know where he’s at 50%? Right up there, he’s at 50. And he ends up when he… Tell me his politics is strange game.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","18:51"
"Donald Trump","He was a cheerleader for NAFTA, which was a disaster for your state. And he enthusiastically voted for China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, decimating your manufacturing and enriching China. It’s really what made China. He voted for it. Pennsylvania lost almost 50% of its manufacturing jobs after Biden’s NAFTA and China disasters. And it wasn’t only him, but it was the thinking. That was the thinking. That’s what they want. Decade after decade, vote after vote, Joe Biden, sleepy Joe has betrayed Pennsylvania. How the hell can you vote for him? Is this a serious… How can you vote for this guy? Congressmen?

And then we got him, at the last question I said, “Do you mean you’re against oil?” “Yes, I’d wean it out.” I said, “Pennsylvania, Texas, are you watching?” You have no choice. Okay. If you stop fracking, which he’s against, you don’t remember? He say, “I’m against fracking. I will ban…” He did this for over a year.

I gradually move away from fracking.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","24:37"

"Biden","Yes. Yes. Exactly. They want to do the same thing I want to do. They want to phase out fossil fuels and we’re going to phase out fossil fuels.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","25:06"

"Speaker 8","I have one final question.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","25:17"
"Donald Trump","Would he close down the oil industry? Would you close down the oil industry?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","25:18"

"Biden","It is a big statement.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","25:26"
"Donald Trump","In terms of business, that’s the biggest statement because basically what he’s saying is he is going to destroy the oil industry. Will you remember that Texas? Will you remember that Pennsylvania, Oklahoma?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","25:27"
"Donald Trump","So will you remember that Pennsylvania, please? By the way, who’s voted here so far? Oh, that’s good. Because Pennsylvania is a very late voting state, which I like actually. For obvious reasons I like that. So that’s also okay. Who has not voted yet? Who doesn’t intend to vote? Who’s not going to vote? You better say that. You’d be in big trouble in this crowd. So who is going to vote for Trump? See, that’s why I brought all that expensive equipment because it’s easier than me saying it, right. Huh? No, it’s great. That’s something brand new, just a couple of days in. We only bring it to certain locations, okay. And even though we got shut out of our main by your governor, that governor. We brought it here, but isn’t that very descriptive?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","25:38"
"Donald Trump","Isn’t that better than me telling you he said this and he said that? There it is. He also said, by the way, he’s going to cut your Social Security. You saw that yesterday, right. In 2016, Pennsylvania voted to fire this corrupt political establishment and you elected an outsider as your president who is finally putting America first. America first. With your vote, we will continue to fight the America… Look, we’re going to fight. We are going to ready. We are going to fight for the American workers and we’re going to lower drug prices, support your police. We’re going to support your police. We’re going to protect your second amendment, which is totally under seize, but don’t worry about it. As long as I’m your president, you don’t have to worry about your 2nd Amendment. Look at what I’ve done so far. It’s been under siege, I can tell you that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","27:08"
"Donald Trump","We’re going to defend our voters. They don’t want to have borders. They want to have open borders. The wall is almost complete, right. And we have the strongest border we’ve ever had. Right now, they want to have open borders. And if you have open borders, you don’t have a country. You don’t have borders, you don’t have a country.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","28:03"

"Donald Trump","Thank you. Yep. Almost finished. Very shortly it’s going to be finished. We just hit 400 miles. Oh boy, that’s a lot. And this is a wall that’s exactly what border patrol and all of the law enforcement people wanted. We built them. I said, “Could you take it easy? This is getting a little expensive.” Loaded up. It’s loaded up with equipment and wires and everything else in addition to the wall, because as you know, the Democrats say, “Walls are obsolete, right.” I said, “No walls and wheels will never be obsolete. Walls and wheels.” Everything else is going to be obsolete. And we want to ensure that more products are proudly stamped with the phrase, that beautiful phrase made in the USA, right. Made in the USA.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","28:22"
"Donald Trump","We are going to deliver record prosperity, epic job growth. We’re doing it already. 11.4 million jobs over the last few months. There’s never been a time in our history where we put that many people to work that quickly. Groundbreaking therapies and safe vaccines that quickly end the pandemic. It’s ending anyway. We’re rounding the turn. It’s ending anyway, but the vaccines are going to be incredible. They’ll be very quick. If somebody else were president, you’d get a vaccine in about four years from now. Normal life, that’s what we want, right. Normal life. We want normal life. We just want normal life. It’s happening very quickly. And next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. I gave working families record-setting tax cuts, biggest tax cut in the history of this country. And this guy’s running on tax increases. I never saw it. I said it yesterday, where I was with a great group.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","29:20"
"Donald Trump","I was in New Hampshire. We should do very well there unless you watch television. He will not win. Then you get polls like you’re leading. And I say, “Why do they keep saying that?” Because you know what they are? They’re suppression polls. They make you depressed. And by being depressed, you say, “Darling, we really like our president a lot, but let’s just go have dinner and then we’ll come home and we’ll come home early and watch the results.” And that didn’t happen four years ago. You said, “Darling, he may not win based on television, but let’s go vote anyway.” And then they had in probably the most exciting evening maybe in the history of television, right. It sure beats any sporting contest, even ESPN admitted that. There’s never been anything like this. Then you went Donald Trump has won the state of Florida, right. Remember? And they said, “Donald Trump has just won the state of Ohio.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","30:17"
"Donald Trump","So with Ohio, I mean, we went for a year. You have to win Ohio. You cannot win unless you win Ohio. And they go, “Donald Trump has just won the state of Ohio,” but here was the problem, won by eight points. That was the biggest victory. They couldn’t believe it. And they said, “There’s something going on here, but I’m sure this is just…” Remember with the hand John King, the hand shaking. Hand started getting a little shaky. No, it got a little bit shaky. And then we won North Carolina. We won, excuse me, a place called Pennsylvania.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","31:15"
"Donald Trump","There is no way. Beginning of the evening, there is no way for Donald Trump to get to 270, right. And they were right. I got the 306. 306 to 223. 306 to 223. That was some evening. I’ll tell you what. I hate to say it and I never thought I’d say it because what happened there was legendary. This is a more important… This is going to be the most important election in our country’s history. So get out and vote. In my second term, I will cut middle-class taxes even more. We have a big tax cut. And Sleepy Joe Biden has pledged the biggest tax hike in history. Did anybody see 60 Minutes last night? Did anybody see 60 Minutes? Which is a total joke of a show, but you saw I released the thing early so they got the full, but it was okay. But did you see his performance on that show? The only thing almost as bad was Kamala with the laugh. That’s so funny. She kept laughing. I said, “Is there something wrong with her too?”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","31:59"
"Donald Trump","She will not be the first woman president. You can’t let that happen. Can’t let that happen. I said, ‘Is there something wrong with her?” She kept laughing at very serious questions. But how about this? Mike was great. But how about this? They asked me, she says, “Are you ready for tough questions?” I thought she was kidding because how do you say. I said, “Just treat me fair.” No, no, no. This is tough questions. And I said, “They do.” And I said, “Let’s see what you have.” And it was just question, question, kill. Always going for the kill. She’s a zippo, but always going for the kill. And then did you see the interview with him? Oh, it was so soft. They’re trying to protect. They try so hard. That’s right. You saw the other day. He’s walking out with ice cream. Mr. Vice President, what flavor is it?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","33:23"
"Donald Trump","I think it’s vanilla and chocolate. I said, “I don’t get questions like that, right.” Now, Pennsylvania gets it. By the way, we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole thing. You’ve got to go out there. Big deal, right. Congressman. This election is a choice between a Trump super recovery. We’re having a super V it’s called. Nobody even thought. We are doing numbers and wait until you see that number on GDP. I don’t know what it is. The Fed said it may be a 35% increase in GDP, the Atlanta Fed. They came out last week. You saw that? I’ll take 25% right now. I’ll take 15 right now. I think the record was seven or eight, but they said it could be 35%. You see car sales through the roof, housing starts through the roof. There’s great things going on, but a tax increased by Biden, all the things he wants to do, regulations.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","34:27"
"Donald Trump","He wants to put back all the regulations, which were terrible. It would take 20 years to get a highway approved, 20 years. A job killer is right. It’s a job killer. So you’d have that against a Biden depression. Let me tell you, if he gets in with what he wants to do, you will have a depression the likes of which we’ve never seen in this country outside of perhaps 1929. It’s a choice between a Trump boom or a Biden lockdown. He wants to lock down the country again. No, we understand the disease. Well, you guys I don’t even talk to you. You’re already on lock down. Are you going to ever open up? Congressman, are you going to get this guy, this clown to open it up? Make sure he can’t get a site. Make sure when the president comes into Pennsylvania, make sure he can’t get a site. He cannot get a site. I don’t want him here. We had one, they shut it down. We had two, they had three, but I like this place. This is quiet intimate.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","35:26"
"Donald Trump","My guys did a good job with about four hours notice. They had like… No, but think of it. Think of it though. I said it before. So he doesn’t want us to have a site. No freedom of speech, right. He doesn’t want us to have a site, but this is the guy that’s counting our balance. Doesn’t work? It doesn’t work. So be very vigilant and watch. Be pole watchers. Watch. Did you see where they fought us because they didn’t want poll watchers? They took us to court and we had a bad decision. We had judge, this judge. So we’ll appeal it, but this judge, obviously, I won’t get too into that. But he said, “No, you can’t have poll watchers.” So he’s saying we can’t even watch as they count the ballots, but we’re going to appeal it and we’ll end up winning.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","36:28"
"Donald Trump","We’ll end up winning. Can you believe it? We can’t have poll watchers the judge said. They fought us on that. They didn’t want people watching them count. Whoever heard of a thing like this? Before I came along, nobody would have sued. That’s why Romney got almost zero. When Romney in Philadelphia, remember he got almost zero votes. How did he get zero votes in a city? But we watch and we’ll sue and we’ll keep doing it and we’ll keep having law enforcement right alongside of us. If Joe Biden and his Democrat socialists are elected, they will delay the vaccine, delay therapies, prolong the pandemic, close your schools. Your schools have to open, and shut down our country. Guy doesn’t have a clue. This guy doesn’t have a clue. Have you seen what this? I mean, we can’t play with the country. The only thing I can tell you for sure, President Xi from China, President Putin from Russia, Kim Jong-Un North Korea, and I could name 40 others. They’re sharp as a tack.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","37:15"
"Donald Trump","They don’t want to deal with Sleepy Joe. One of them said to me, one of the leaders said, “Well, I hope you win because we don’t want to deal with somebody that sleeps all the time.” Do you believe him? No, he just announced a lid. He announced another lid. Somebody could say, “Oh, this is brilliant. This preventive defense.” First of all, did you ever see preventive defense? It always loses. A team shuts down the other team for three and a half quarters. They’re leading by six, then they go prevent defense. They lose all the time, right? Two touchdowns scored on them. They shut a team down for the whole game. Then they go, “Let’s go prevent.” Well, I don’t know if he’s doing that. I don’t think so. I think he’s doing it because he can’t answer questions, really.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","38:23"
"Donald Trump","When these clowns back here, bad corrupt people, when they ask him questions, he cannot answer the simplest question. How about where they gave him questions on a teleprompter? They said, “Here are the questions.” And they wrote out the answers to him and he’s responding. Can you imagine I have the press here. Sir, what about this? What about that? What about? I won’t tell you some of the tough ones because there are some questions that never work out well, no matter how you answer them. They can make whatever. They’ll take the answer that could be perfect, and they’ll make… So they’ll ask a question, and then they said, let’s say, “Oh, well that means they gave them the questions.” Whoever heard of this before? And then the way the tech fakers close section 230 anybody, they closed down because the government gave them special protection.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","39:11"
"Donald Trump","The way they closed down anybody. They banned the New York Post from being on. Can you believe it, the New York Post? Fourth largest. No, it’s amazing. In an interview that aired last night, Biden said he opposes letting young Americans resume their lives, even though most are at extremely low risk, 99.99. Now as an example, I had it and here I am. My wife had it, first lady had it. But the legendary Barron Trump had it. They say, “Sir, your son Barron tested positive.” I said, “Oh, that’s terrible.” 14 minutes later, how’s Barron? Oh, he’s better. He’s fine because they’re stronger than us. They have an immune system. I don’t know what the hell it is, but how’s he doing? 15 minutes later. How’s he doing? He’s fine, sir. Barron, are you’re feeling okay? Nothing wrong with me, dad. I think he had the sniffles barely. 99.98% of those under the age 50 fully recover. But Sleepy Joe wants to keep the whole country on lockdown, keep them in their homes while letting rioters and looters run wild. We call these protests. This is not a meeting. We call them protests. You know why? Because the only thing you can do in Pennsylvania is a protest. You can’t go to church. You can’t pray to your God. You can’t be with your pastors, your priests, your rabbis, you can’t be none of that. You can’t do anything. You can’t go shopping. You can’t open your stores, but if you want to protest and burn the hell out of your city, no problem, you can do that. So when I was told a couple of months ago about Pennsylvania and others. Minnesota we’re going to win too. We’re going to win Minnesota because we saved Minneapolis.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","40:04"
"Donald Trump","I sent in the National Guard, took about a half an hour, but we’re going to win that. But when you think about it, you can’t do anything. And then they have this little clause unless you are protesting. I said, “Good. So these are no longer rallies. They are friendly protests.” When the China virus arrived, we moved heaven and earth to fight the disease. We banned travel from China and Europe. Sleepy Joe didn’t want to. He said, “Oh, you shouldn’t do that. You’re xenophobic.” Right. He called me racist. He called me everything. That was in January. Two months later, he still thought he was right, and then he had to apologize. And then he runs and then he said, “Trump should have done it earlier.” Except he would know, think of it. How does he get out of that one? And the fake news doesn’t want to report that. So in January I wanted to do it, but in March he thought I should have never done it. Same with Pelosi. She was dancing in the streets. Nancy Pelosi, Crazy Nancy, crazy. She’s crazy as a bedbug.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","42:04"

We have a good chance of taking back the House. I’ll tell you. We have a good chance. Of course, she is crazy. We airlifted medical supplies, built hospitals from scratch, slashed red tape, pioneered groundbreaking therapies. I wish Cuomo in New York would have used the convention center for seniors. If Cuomo would have you used the convention center for seniors and the big ship. We sent the big hospitals ship in, sitting there practically empty all the time.

"Donald Trump","We reduced the fatality rate, 85%. Think of that. That’s because of what we’ve come up with over the last little while. As I said before, here I am right. And saved over 2 million American lives.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","44:05"
"Donald Trump","So when this first came, people were projecting that it could be as bad as 2.2 million. Right? I think we saved by shutting down, by doing what we did, by learning the disease, and now we have therapies, therapeutics, we have all of the different things. The vaccines coming. I really think we saved 2 million lives. They never say that. The fake news will never say that. And we will deliver 100 million doses of a safe vaccine before the end of the year. Seniors will be first in line for the vaccine because they’re the most vulnerable, as you know. We learned that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","44:19"

When does China want Sleepy Joe to win? They own him. They own Sleepy Joe. Did you see his email where they want $10 million a year, a year for introductory purposes. You know who they’re going to introduce him to, Sleepy Joe. So the son never made 25 cents. All of a sudden Biden becomes vice-president and now he’s making millions of dollars a year. Unbelievable. And Biden, they got, Biden got a lot of it. Look, he got 10%. right? It went to the big man. I don’t consider him a big man, but went to the big man, 10%. and the press doesn’t want to talk about it.

I am running against the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics. I am. I really believe that. And think of it, think of it, and I have to be very careful the way I say this. You know why? If I say, if I lose, they go back. We have breaking news. President Trump thinks he’s going to lose. They did it once before.

Barack Hussein Obama went out over the last three, four days. He’s drawing flies, flies. Now nobody’s going. Obama’s out and they will never show it. They don’t turn… See here, they never show the extent of it. They have the opposite. They never show it. They should show it because nobody is showing up to watch Barack Hussein Obama. See the red lights? See those red lights, all those red lights? That means you’re on live. Are you ready? They just turned them off because I was insulting. Look, they just went off. Can you believe it?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","01:14:41"
"Donald Trump","They’re tormented, the fake news. They’re tormented. In one way, they have to have it on because it’s ratings. It’s big, big, beautiful ratings. In another way, CNN hates when I say CNN is fake corrupt news. They hate it. You’ll see it go on and off a little bit. Now they just went off. Did you see that? Boom. Anytime I start talking, they say, “Now let’s go to a commercial break now, please.” No, they’re tormented because they want the ratings. Without it, they get terrible ratings. They want the ratings. They’re fantastic ratings. But at the same time, they don’t want to be talked about in a bad manner, right? But you have to talk about it because they’re corrupt. They have to report the news. They are the enemy of the people. They really are. They’re the enemy of the people.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","01:15:28"
"Donald Trump","For generations, America’s destiny was made in Fords and won in places like Bethlehem and Bristol, Scranton. By the way, he has nothing to do with Scranton. Altoona, Easton, and Allentown. They were tough American men and strong American women who gave their heart, sweat, and soul for their families, their country, and for freedom. We stand on the shoulders of the Pennsylvania Patriots who fought the battles, mined the coal, worked the assembly lines, loaded the rail cars, poured the steel that built the middle-class. It built the middle-class. Raised up our great skyscrapers, laid down the battleships, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and the best is yet to come.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","01:16:19"

"Donald Trump","We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. Together with the incredible people of Pennsylvania, we have made America powerful again, our military. We have made America wealthy again, our stock market. Your 401ks, let’s keep them up there. Don’t throw them away in two years and you’ll say, “The president told… The previous president told me that was going to happen. I don’t think that’s going to happen.” Your 401ks are hitting records. Does anybody have a 401k?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-allentown-pa-october-26","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Allentown, PA October 26","01:17:57"
