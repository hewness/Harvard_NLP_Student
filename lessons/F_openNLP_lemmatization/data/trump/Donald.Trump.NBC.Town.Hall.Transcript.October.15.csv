"Speaker 1","From NBC News, Decision 2020, President Trump Town Hall. Live from the Perez Art Museum in Miami, here’s Savannah Guthrie.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","05:16"
"Savannah Guthrie","Hi everybody, and good evening. It’s good to have you with us, and welcome to Miami and our town hall with President Donald Trump. And we want to say right off the top, this is not how things were supposed to go tonight. This was supposed to be a town hall debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. But after the President contracted COVID, the debate commission announced it would have to be a virtual debate because of health concerns. The President then said he would not participate in a virtual debate. At that point, Joe Biden scheduled a town hall tonight in Pennsylvania on another network, and now the President is doing the same, his own town hall with the same venue format and time as NBC’s town hall with Joe Biden last week. So the two candidates go head to head tonight, though, not face to face, each in a key battleground state.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","05:28"
"Savannah Guthrie","And tonight, the President will be taking questions from voters here in Miami, who we should mention are socially distanced and they’re wearing masks. And I should say, this audience looks a bit like America, it’s divided. Some here voted for the president in 2016 and plan to again, some support Joe Biden, and some say they are truly undecided. We’re going to get a mix of questions on a range of topics, and we’re going to get to those questions in a moment. But first with all of that ado, welcome, Mr. President, and thank you for being here.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","06:11"
"President Trump","That was very well stated, I have to say. Good job.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","06:37"
"Savannah Guthrie","Thank you. We’re glad you’re here, we’re glad you’re well. We send our best to the First Lady and to Barron.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","06:40"

"Savannah Guthrie","Do you have any remaining symptoms from COVID?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","06:46"
"President Trump","Nothing whatsoever, I’m great, I feel good. I was in North Carolina today and did a big rally with tremendous turnout, and I just feel really good. Florida, Pennsylvania, were- They said, “Let’s go to the hospital.” I said, “That’s okay. I’m going to respond to what you say.” And we went over to Walter Reed, where you have tremendous professionals. They gave me Regeneron and Remdeceiver both. And all I know is I felt good the following day, I felt really good.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","06:48"
"Savannah Guthrie","Did the doctors ever tell you that they saw pneumonia on your lung scans?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","07:36"
"President Trump","No, but they said the lungs are a little bit different, a little bit perhaps infected, and-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","07:39"
"Savannah Guthrie","Infected with?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","07:46"
"President Trump","I don’t know. I mean, I didn’t do too much asking. I really felt good. I didn’t have much of a problem with the lungs. I did have a little bit of a temperature. Obviously, I felt there was something missing, and then I tested, I tested positive.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","07:48"
"Savannah Guthrie","Well, let’s talk about testing because there’s a little bit of a, I guess, confusion about this. And I think we can clear it up.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","08:01"
"President Trump","Yeah, and there shouldn’t be.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","08:06"
"Savannah Guthrie","Your first positive test was Thursday, October 1st, okay? When was your last negative test? When did you last remember having a negative test?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","08:07"
"President Trump","Well, I test quite a bit, and I can tell you that before the debate, which I thought it was a very good debate, and I felt fantastically, I had no problems before.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","08:18"
"Savannah Guthrie","Did you test the day of the debate?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","08:27"
"President Trump","I don’t know, I don’t even remember. I test all the time. But I can tell you this, after the debate, I guess a day or so, I think it was Thursday evening, maybe even late Thursday evening, I tested positive. That’s when I first found out about it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","08:29"
"Savannah Guthrie","Well back to the debate, because the debate commission’s rules, it was the honor system.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","08:44"
"President Trump","Yeah.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","08:48"
"Savannah Guthrie","Would be that you would come with a negative test. You say you don’t know if you’ve got a test on the day of the debate?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","08:48"
"President Trump","I had no problem. Again, the doctors do it. I don’t ask them. I test all the time. And they-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","08:53"
"Savannah Guthrie","Did you take a test, though, on the day of the debate?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","08:57"
"President Trump","If you ask as the doctor, they’ll give you a perfect answer. But they take a test and I leave and I go about my business.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","09:00"
"Savannah Guthrie","So you did you take a test on the day of the debate, I guess is the bottom line?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","09:06"
"President Trump","I probably did, and I took a test the day before and the day before, and I was always in great shape, and I was in great shape for the debate. And it was only after the debate, a period of time after the debate that I said, “That’s interesting.” And they took a test and it tested positive.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","09:07"
"Savannah Guthrie","Just to button it up, do you take a test every single day?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","09:25"
"President Trump","No. No, but I take a lot of tests.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","09:26"
"Savannah Guthrie","Okay. And you don’t know if you took a test the day of the debate?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","09:29"
"President Trump","Possibly I did, possibly I didn’t. But the doctor has very accurate information and it’s not only that doctor, it’s many doctors. The one thing, if you’re President, you have a lot of doctors you’re surrounded by. But I was in great shape for the debate. And sometime after the debate, I tested positive, then that’s when they decided to, let’s go.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","09:31"
"Savannah Guthrie","Okay, good. I hopefully provided some clarity for folks. Let’s talk about the event that was held at the White House on the Saturday before you tested positive. Subsequent to that, 13 people connected to that event tested positive. There was an outdoor reception, you’ve seen the pictures. There was an indoor reception. People were not wearing masks. My question to you is, at this point in the pandemic, knowing what we know, shouldn’t you have known better? Shouldn’t the White House know better than to hold an event like that?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","09:50"
"President Trump","Well, they do a lot of testing in the White House, they test everybody including me, but they test everybody. And something happened. But as far as the mask is concerned, I’m good with masks. I’m okay with masks. I tell people, wear a mask. But just the other day, they came out with a statement that 85% of the people that wear masks catch it. So this is a very-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","10:19"
"Savannah Guthrie","It didn’t say that. I know that study.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","10:37"
"President Trump","That’s what I heard, and that’s what I saw. And regardless, but everybody’s tested and they’re tested often. And I also knew that, hey, I’m President. I have to see people. I can’t be in a basement. I can’t be in a room. I can’t be… I have to be out.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","10:40"
"Savannah Guthrie","You can see people with a mask, though, right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","10:56"
"President Trump","I can, but people with masks are catching it all the time. I mean, if you look at the Governor of Virginia, he was known for a mask. If you look at Thom Tillis, a great guy, he always had a mask, and they caught it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","10:58"
"Savannah Guthrie","Well, there are pictures of Thom Tillis, actually with one of Judge Barrett’s kids not wearing a mask. But you know Chris Christie, he was part of your debate prep.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","11:09"
"President Trump","Yeah.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","11:16"
"Savannah Guthrie","He was, I believe at that event. He came out tonight, he was sick, very sick. He was in the hospital for about a week.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","11:16"
"President Trump","Yes, I know this.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","11:22"
"Savannah Guthrie","He came out tonight and said, “I was wrong not to wear a mask.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","11:22"
"President Trump","Well, I mean, he has to say that. I think it’s great, he’s a friend of mine. He’s a good guy. And wrong or not wrong, you have to understand, as President, I can’t be locked in a room someplace for the next year and just stay and do nothing. And every time I go into a crowd, I was with the parents of our fallen heroes. These people are the most incredible people. And they came up to me and they would hug me, and they would touch me, and I’m not to not let them do it, to be honest with you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","11:26"
"Savannah Guthrie","Now, there was an event with the gold star families the day after the Supreme Court event.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","11:56"
"President Trump","There was, exactly right. We had a gold star event with the most incredible people you’ve ever seen. And I could have chosen not to talk to them, or to keep everybody away. And you know what? I don’t think that’s probably where it was caught, but maybe it was.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","11:59"
"Savannah Guthrie","I going to say, you bring it up, you brought it up yourself. I mean, are you trying to suggest that? Do you believe a grieving military family gave you a COVID?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","12:11"
"President Trump","No, I don’t know where it came from, and you don’t know where it came from, and the doctors don’t know where it came from. But as the President, I have to be out there. I also know-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","12:18"
"Savannah Guthrie","Well, there’s no one that says you can’t be out there, but it’s just about wearing masks and having… For example, your rallies.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","12:26"
"President Trump","I know this.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","12:30"
"Savannah Guthrie","Your rallies don’t require masks.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","12:30"
"President Trump","I mean, let’s see, Kamala. She’s got people now, people have it, and I’m not blaming her. I’m not saying, “Oh, she did a terrible thing.” As President, I have to be out there. I can’t be in a basement. I can’t be locked in a very beautiful room someplace in the White House. And I want to see the gold star families, and I want to see everybody. And I also say to people all the time, it’s risky doing it. It is risky doing it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","12:33"
"Savannah Guthrie","But as President, you’re right. You want to be a leader, but you also are a leader and a setter of an example. And if you’re not wearing a mask when your administration is saying, “Best practice right now is wear a mask,” no, it’s not foolproof. But that will-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","12:55"
"President Trump","But many people are catching it. Many people are getting this disease that was sent to us by China, and it shouldn’t have been allowed to happen. But many people are getting this. And I mean, nobody’s being blamed. Everybody is working hard to get this thing out of our country, get it out of the world. Look at what’s going on in Europe, massive spikes. They’ve done a very good job, but now you take a look today at the UK, you take a look at Spain and France and Italy. There’s tremendous spikes.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","13:09"
"Savannah Guthrie","But our death rate is worse than, well, not Spain, but those other countries.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","13:38"
"President Trump","Well, I have thing right here that will tell you exactly the opposite.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","13:38"
"Savannah Guthrie","Me too.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","13:41"
"President Trump","The UK is up 2500%, because I knew you’d be doing this. I know you very well. The UK is up 2500%. The EU is up 722%. And the United States is down 21%.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","13:41"
"Savannah Guthrie","But we have per… Our deaths per capita is among the highest of all-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","13:55"
"President Trump","Excess mortality.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","14:01"
"Savannah Guthrie","I’m sorry?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","14:01"
"President Trump","Excess mortality, we’re a winner on the excess mortality. And what we’ve done has been amazing. And we have done an amazing job. And it’s rounding the corner and we have the vaccines coming, and we have the therapies coming. And I’ll tell you what, one thing. When I got it, I had a choice. Do nothing, or use some of the things that we’re looking at, like in this case, Regeneron. and Eli Lilly makes something that’s supposed to be incredible. And I think that maybe I wouldn’t be doing this discussion with you right now. We have therapies now and cures, maybe you can use the word cure, but we have therapies that are absolutely incredible, Savannah.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","14:01"
"Savannah Guthrie","I want to pick up on something you just said. You said we’re rounding the corner.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","14:39"
"President Trump","I believe we’re rounding the corner, yes.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","14:42"
"Savannah Guthrie","10% of the country approximately has had COVID. That means 80%-90%, 90%, let’s do the math, is still vulnerable.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","14:43"
"President Trump","Right, right. That’s right.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","14:51"
"Savannah Guthrie","There’s been some talk, including from the White House lately that perhaps it approves of what’s called herd immunity. That’s where you basically just let young people and everybody gets sick. You try to protect the old people and those who are sick. And hopefully, it gets up to a certain level, and now we’re all immune.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","14:51"
"President Trump","Yeah.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","15:08"
"Savannah Guthrie","So let’s just be clear about it. It also means more deaths. Do you support herd immunity as a strategy? Essentially, just let people get sick?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","15:08"
"President Trump","The cure can not be worse than the problem itself. We did the right thing. We were expected to lose 2,200,000 people, and maybe more than that. We’re at 210,000 people. One person is too much, it should have never happened because of China. It happened because of China. And you have to get that and understand that. But it shouldn’t have happened. But we were expected to lose, if you look at the original charts from original doctors who are respected by everybody, 2,200,00 people.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","15:18"
"Savannah Guthrie","That 2 million figure, though, is if you literally did nothing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","15:49"
"President Trump","We saved 2 million people.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","15:53"
"Savannah Guthrie","The 2 million figure is if you did absolutely nothing, it would be 2 million. The question is, should the deaths be better than 200,000, when-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","15:53"
"President Trump","I don’t know, let me tell you what is happening. I left North Carolina, which I love. I left Pennsylvania. We won a big case in Michigan because that governor has a lockdown where nobody but her husband can do anything. He can go boating and do whatever he wants, but nobody else can. The fact is we’re winning all these cases because it’s unconstitutional what they’re doing. And I think they’re doing it for political reasons. But the fact is the cure, you can’t let this continue to go on with the lockdowns. And I believe that on November 4th, you’re going to have a lot of these governors.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","16:01"
"President Trump","Look at what’s happening to New York. New York is a mess. They lost almost 40,000 people. They have a lockdown like you’ve never seen. Now they’re open, it’s like a ghost town. And Savannah, it’s very important. People are leaving New York by the thousands, and you’re going to have a hard time ever building it up again. So that cure, that so called cure that you talk about, it can’t be worse than the problem. The problem is a bad problem.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","16:35"

"President Trump","Well, I did put it in very early, as you know, Joe Biden was two months behind me, and he called me xenophobic and racist and everything else, because I put it in. And it turned out that I was 100% right. I also put it on Europe, very early, because I saw there was a lot of infection in Europe. And it’s sort of an amazing question. And I appreciate the question, and respect the question, but the news doesn’t get out the right answer.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","24:56"
"President Trump","Because I put on a travel ban far earlier than Dr. Fauci thought it was necessary. Who I like.

And I did it, actually against the advice of a lot of people, including Nancy Pelosi who had no clue what she was doing. And, Biden.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","25:18"
"President Trump","When I put on the travel ban… You know, I put it on in January. The end of January. When I put on the travel ban Joe Biden, and others, said, “This is ridiculous.

And we went into the ventilator business, because this country was not equipped with ventilators. And I’m not blaming anybody for it. But we’re now making thousands of ventilators a month, and we have all we can use. We’re sending them all over the world, because the world needs them.

"Cristy Montesinos Alonso","We’re a hard-working middle-class family of four. My husband and I are both self-employed, and we have to get our own individual healthcare.

"President Trump","Good. So we got rid of the individual mandate on Obamacare, which was the worst part of Obamacare, and now you could actually say it’s not Obamacare because that’s how big it was, where you had to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance, so we got rid of that. That was a big, big thing. And by doing that, and we will always have… By the way, we’re always protecting people with pre-existing conditions, and I can’t say that more strongly, but we’ve been able to bring healthcare costs way down. Now, I took over Obamacare, got rid of the individual mandate, made it good, managed it much better. Remember, they had the $5 billion website disaster, and all of the problems they had. The problem with Obamacare, it’s not good. We’d like to terminate it, and we want a much less expensive healthcare that’s a much better healthcare, and that’s where we’re aiming. And if we can do that, and we have a very good chance of doing it, but we’ve also brought down the price of Obamacare. The problem with Obamacare, it basically is never going to be great, and I want to give great healthcare. So important.

He says he’s leaning toward Biden and voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. And his question was a, a second stimulus payment has been broadly agreed upon by the Republicans and Democrats, and yet, now we’re in October and it’s still not passed. Why not use your office to make the second stimulus payment a separate targeted emergency relief package to help Americans weather the pandemic?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","38:16"
"President Trump","Well, we’ve actually passed three packages, and we’re on our fourth, and I agree with him 100%. He should vote for me. The problem you have is Nancy Pelosi. She couldn’t care less about the worker. She couldn’t care less about our people. And we should have a stimulus, and I want a stimulus. The Republicans will approve a stimulus. The problem is she doesn’t want to do it because she thinks it’s bad for her election. The fact is, she’s wrong because people know she’s in our way, she’s not approving it, she doesn’t appreciate our people, and she doesn’t appreciate, at all, our workers.

"Savannah Guthrie","People do not love the back and forth of Washington, but this has been a rollercoaster. Back in early October, you one day tweeted, “No more negotiations until after election day.

"Barbara Peña","Good to see you. So corporate tax rates are a hot button issue and you have cut corporate tax rates. And your opponent, Joe Biden, is planning to raise them. A lot of Americans think that corporations don’t pay their share of taxes and want to see those tax rates increase. What do you say to those Americans to maybe tell them why you want the corporate tax rate lower and why that helps them?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","40:54"
"President Trump","It’s a great question. We’ve created more jobs than this country has ever created. We were up to 160 million jobs. We were never even close to that number. We were just hitting 160 million jobs, companies are pouring into our nation because of the tax rate, and if Biden comes in and raises taxes on everybody, including middle income taxes, which he wants to do, you will blow this thing, and you’ll end up with a depression, the likes of which you’ve never had. That’s what’s going to happen. We have something that’s really good. The reason we’re coming back so strong is because we built a very strong foundation. Companies are moving in. Car companies are moving into Michigan, into Ohio, into South Carolina, and North Carolina just today, so what’s happening is, they’re coming in because we reduced the taxes. Our taxes, our corporate taxes were the highest in the world, and now they’re among the lower taxes. They’re not the lowest, but they’re among the lowest. And what that means, is jobs, but also we’re doing a very big, and we’ve done a very big, middle income tax package. So if we get in, we’re going to do the middle income tax package, but it’s a great question. And if he comes along and raises rates, all those companies that are coming in, they will leave the U.S. so fast your head will spin. We can’t let that happen. Thank you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","41:20"
"Savannah Guthrie","On the subject of taxes, as you know, the New York times has obtained, it says years of your tax returns among other things, it says that you have debts of approximately $421 million that you have personally guaranteed, and that will come due in the next four years. The question is, on behalf of voters, who do you owe $421 million to?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","42:33"
"President Trump","Okay, first of all, let me answer. What they did is illegal, number one. Also, the numbers are all wrong, with the numbers they released. And just so you understand, when you have a lot of real estate, I have real estate, you know a lot of it. Okay? Right down the road, Doral, big stuff, great stuff. When I decided to run, I’m very underlevered, fortunately, but I’m very underlevered. I have a very, very small percentage of debt compared. In fact, some of it, I did as favors to institutions that wanted to loan me money. $400 million compared to the assets that I have, all of these great properties all over the world, and frankly, The Bank of America building in San Francisco. I don’t love what’s happening to San Francisco. 1290 Avenue of the Americas, one of the biggest office buildings.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","42:53"

But are you confirming that, yes, you do owe some $400 million?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","43:37"
"President Trump","What I’m saying is that, it’s a tiny percentage of my net worth.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","43:47"
"Savannah Guthrie","That sounds like yes.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","43:50"
"President Trump","And you’ll see that soon because we’re doing things. We’ve given, I think it’s 108 or 112 pages of financial detail to elections, and we have to file as the president, as any politician, you have to file. Nobody ever looks at that. When they do, they see how incredible a company is, but more importantly, they see where this debt is. No, I don’t owe Russia money. I owe a very, very small… It’s called mortgages.

"President Trump","Not that I know of, but I will probably, because it’s so easy to solve, and if you’d like to do, I will let you know who I owe, whatever small amount of money. I want to say two things. Number one, it’s a very small amount of money. Number two, it’s very straight. It’s very, very straight, but it’s a tiny percentage of the worth.

"President Trump","So that one’s solved. That’s good. I am under audit. No person in their right mind would release, prior to working out the deal with the IRS. And I’ll go a step further. I’m treated very badly by the IRS. They treat me very, very badly. You have people in there from previous administrations that treat me very badly, but we’re under audit. It’s very routine, in many ways, but we’re under audit. They like to change the game, change the rules, do everything. You saw what they did with the tea party people.

"President Trump","No, except common sense, and intelligence, and having lawyers that say… Because I would love to release them, and as soon as we come to a conclusion, I will release them, and very gladly, but if you go to elections, and if you take a look, you’ll see 112, I think it’s 112, it talks about the income, which is rather massive. It talks about all of the properties. They have them listed. You can never learn more, but you know what happened? People went there. All the reporters went. There was a feeding frenzy. This was originally, when I filed it. And I filed it every year. I update it every year. My son is here. They run the company. I don’t run the company.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","45:40"

"Savannah Guthrie","But is that true?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","46:24"

"President Trump","No, I don’t know. I can tell you this. If they have my tax returns, as you know, they have to go to jail. It’s illegal, but their numbers were wrong, but let me tell you what else. I don’t owe money to any of these sinister people. This has been going on for years now. Russia, Russia, Russia. It turned out to be a hoax, and it turned out to be that Hillary Clinton and the Democrats were dealing with Russia, not me. It’s a whole hoax. So I would not mind at all saying who it is, but it’s a very small… When you look at vast properties like I have, and they’re big, and they’re beautiful, and they’re well located. When you look at that, the amount of money, $400 million is a peanut. It’s extremely underlevered. And it’s levered with normal banks. Not a big deal.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","46:31"

"Adam Schucher","Four years ago, Senate leadership said it was inappropriate to push through a nominee in an election year, yet they fast-tracked your nominee for the Supreme Court just today. The question I have for you is, what do you say to the voter that thinks it’s hypocritical to act in that manner and that they can’t trust Republicans’ word?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","51:16"
"President Trump","So when I was elected, and when a president is elected, they’re elected for a period of four years. And Justice Ginsburg said it best. I think, talking about president Obama having to do with somebody else, that the president is put there for four years, not for three years. So during this fourth year, it happened to come up, unfortunately, because I had great respect for Justice Ginsburg. But a vacancy happened to come up, and we picked somebody that’s outstanding. She has been an absolute star, and I’m extremely proud of it. But again, plenty of time.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","51:37"
"President Trump","There’s plenty of time. We’re going to do it before the election, but we also have much time after the election. But there’s no reason to wait, because it’s almost unanimous, it seems to me, certainly within the Republican party. And frankly, most of the Democrats within closed rooms, I guarantee you that. This is an outstanding person, and I’m using my fourth term. And if you look at it and if you put the shoe on the other foot, if they had this, they would do it 100%. So there’s been 29 times when this has happened. All 29 times a president has done exactly what I’ve done.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","52:10"
"Savannah Guthrie","To the voter’s point, I’ll just say that in 2016, you were on another show, actually another morning show, and you were asked whether President Obama should nominate a Supreme Court Justice Merrick Garland. And you said, “I think the Senate should wait until the next president, and let the president pick.” Now that was eight months before the election. This is three weeks before the election.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","52:43"

"President Trump","I have a lot of respect for Judge Garland. I want to tell you that. But I’ll tell you, the whole ball game changed when I saw the way they treated Justice Kavanaugh. I have never seen any human being, and I’m not just talking about Supreme Court… I have never seen a human being treated so badly with false accusations and everything else. I have never seen anything like it. And you know what the truth is, Savannah? Like it or not, the ball game changed a lot.

"President Trump","Well, I think she’ll have to make that decision. I don’t think she has any conflict at all. A Supreme Court judge does not have… They can make their own decision. They actually have additional power to make that decision. It would be totally up to her. I would think that she would be able to rule either for me or against me, being I don’t see any conflict whatsoever. We have an election coming up. I think it’s the most important election in the history of our country. If for any chance, and it probably won’t… And I hope it doesn’t ever get to the Supreme Court.

"President Trump","Because believe it or not, I never asked her about it. I never talked about it. I didn’t talk about any of the obvious things that you could talk about. And I think a lot of people in my position might. But in speaking to a lot of very brilliant people and people that do this for a living, they say it’s better not to talk. So I talked to her about life. I talked to her about the fact, “Would you like to do this? Are you willing to do this?” Because it’s a tremendous burden.

Wade is ultimately overturned in the future, what protections would be put in place or kept for where the mother’s life is in jeopardy in relation to high risk pregnancies?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","55:15"
"President Trump","Well, again, I’m not ruling on this. And Roe v. Wade is something that a lot of people would say, obviously, you’re going to speak to somebody. Also two other great Justices, Justice Gorsuch, and Justice Kavanaugh… I never spoke to them about Roe v. Wade. I never spoke to them about election laws. I never spoke to them about anything. And I’ve done the right thing from a moral standpoint. I don’t even know from a legal standpoint, but it was the right thing. I think, depending on what happens with Roe v. Wade, I think that perhaps it could get sent down to the states, and the states would decide. I also think perhaps nothing will happen. I have not talked to her about it. I think it would be inappropriate to talk to her about it. And some people would say, “You can talk to about it.” I just think it would be inappropriate.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","55:36"
"Savannah Guthrie","But what is your preference? Because agreed, that’s not something you should talk to the judge about. But would you like to see Roe versus Wade overturned?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","56:22"
"President Trump","I would like to see a brilliant jurist, a brilliant person who has done this in great depth and has actually skirted this issue for a long time, make a decision. And that’s why I chose her. I think that she’s going to make a great decision. I did not tell her what decision to make. And I think it would be inappropriate to say right now, because I don’t want to do anything to influence her. I want her to get approved, and then I want her to go by the law. And I know she’s going to make a great decision for our country, along with the other two people I put there.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","56:31"
"Savannah Guthrie","You’re running as a pro-life Republican. Most pro-life Republicans would like to see Roe v. Wade overturned and abortion banned.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","57:03"
"President Trump","Many of them would. Perhaps most of them would. I am telling you, I don’t want to do anything to influence anything right now. I don’t want to go out tomorrow and say, “Oh, he’s trying to give her a signal.” Because I didn’t speak to her about it. I’ve done the right thing in so doing. How she’s going to rule, you’re going to find out perhaps. Or you might not find out. It may never get there. It may never get there. We’ll see what happens.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","57:09"
"Savannah Guthrie","All right. We have another question. This is Cindy Velez. She is undecided. She says she’s leaning to Biden, and she did vote for Clinton in 2016. She’s registered as a Democrat. Hi Cindy. What’s your question?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","57:32"
"Cindy Velez","Good evening, Savannah.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","57:43"
"President Trump","Hi, Cindy. Thank you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","57:44"
"Cindy Velez","Good evening, Mr. President.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","57:44"

"Cindy Velez","As the mother of a young male of color, I have reason to respect authority, not only because it’s the right thing to do, but also out of fear that he may face profiling or be considered a criminal. As an educator, I’ve also had similar conversations with my high school students. Mr. President, what will you and your administration do to better prepare our law enforcement officers to work in collaboration with the communities that they serve and also to protect the lives of innocent Black and Latinos from police brutality and injustice?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","57:47"
"President Trump","Right. I fully understand the question, and I saw everything that you saw over the summer. And it was a terrible thing, a terrible thing to watch. We have a Senator named Tim Scott from South Carolina. He came up with a bill that should have been approved. It was great. It was a bill that was strong in terms of law enforcement, and strong in terms of enforcing the proper thing, and doing the proper thing by law enforcement. And the Democrats just wouldn’t go for it. They wouldn’t go for it at all. And I don’t know why, because it was a really great bill. But I do have to say this. And some people don’t like it when I say it, but a lot of people agree. I have done more for the African American community than any president. With the exception of Abraham Lincoln. Criminal justice reform, prison reform, historically Black colleges and universities. I got them funded.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","58:20"
"President Trump","They were on a year to year basis. They could have been put out of business. As soon as our country had a little bad year, they would have said, “I’m sorry, we’re not going to fund you.” I got them 10 year funding and financing. And more than they even asked for. I became very friendly with a lot of the heads. But we’ve done more… And of course, opportunity zones. But criminal justice reform, everybody said it could not be done. President Obama and Biden never even tried to do it. They never even tried. But I say that, and I say it often. I’ll say it loud, and I’m very proud of it. And I have a great relationship because of what I’ve done with the African-American community. I’m very proud of it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","59:12"
"Savannah Guthrie","Let’s go to our next question. We have Paulette Dale, she leans slightly to Biden. She voted for Clinton in 2016. She’s registered as a Republican. Paulette, what’s your question?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","59:50"
"Paulette Dale","Thank you. Good evening, Mr. President.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","59:58"
"President Trump","Thank you. Thank you very much.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","01:00:00"
"Paulette Dale","I have to say, you have a great smile.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","01:00:01"
"President Trump","Got you. Thank you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","01:00:04"
"Paulette Dale","He does. You’re so handsome when you smile. As the daughter of immigrants to the United States who fled Eastern Europe due to religious persecution, the United States immigration policies are very personal for me.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","01:00:09"
"President Trump","Right.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","01:00:25"
"Paulette Dale","Surveys show that most Americans, and the majority of Republicans, support the Dreamers program. So my question for you, Mr. President, is if you are elected to a second term, do you expect to pursue your previous efforts to cut the DACA program?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","01:00:27"
"President Trump","Yeah.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","01:00:51"
"Paulette Dale","Why or why not?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","01:00:51"
"President Trump","DACA is somewhat different than Dreamers. You understand that, and you understand it better than anybody, probably, in this room. Where do you come from, by the way, originally? Where?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","01:00:54"
"Paulette Dale","My grandparents were from Russia and Poland.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","01:01:02"
"President Trump","That’s very good. Okay. So we are going to take care of DACA. We’re going to take care of Dreamer. It’s working right now. We’re negotiating different aspects of immigration and immigration law. We’ve built now, over 400 miles of border wall, southern border. Mexico is working very closely with us. We have the strongest border we’ve ever had. We want people to come into our country. They have to come in legally. But we are working very hard on the DACA program. And you will be, I think, very happy over the course of the next year.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","01:01:05"
"Paulette Dale","Thank you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","01:01:39"
"President Trump","Because I feel the same way as you do about it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","01:01:39"
"Paulette Dale","Thank you, Mr. President.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","01:01:41"

"Savannah Guthrie","Mr. President, in point of fact, the DACA program… Under your administration, no new applicants are allowed. And in fact, the DACA recipients now have to renew every year as opposed to every two years. So in fact, the DACA program has been curtailed by your administration.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","01:01:43"
"President Trump","Well, what happens is because of the pandemic, much changed on the immigration front. Mexico is heavily infected, as you know. And we’ve made it very, very difficult to come in because of the pandemic, and other reasons, and crime. But we have a very strong border right now, and we have to keep it that way. But we want people to come into our country, but they have to come in through a merit system, and they have to come in legally. And people are very, very happy with it. You haven’t heard any complaints about that. But what happened is because of the pandemic, we have to be extra cautious.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","01:01:59"
"Savannah Guthrie","You have been promising this immigration bill since, well, at least July, when you told my colleague on Telemundo it was coming. But nothing’s come yet.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","01:02:32"
"President Trump","It’s very happy. The fact is, we got rid of catch and release, which is a disaster. You catch somebody. They could be a murderer. That could be a rapist, and we’re supposed to release them into our country. These are the laws that I inherited. We ended that program. Now, I think you’re going to see something very, very good. The whole immigration… If you look at what’s going on, people used to pour into our country. And especially during the pandemic, I think even you, Savannah, will be very impressed with what we’ve done.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","01:02:39"

"President Trump","Sure.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","01:03:07"
"Savannah Guthrie","I think about people sitting out there tonight. There are some who love you. Some of them are sitting right around here, and some who will never vote for you. But there are people in the middle. There are people who aren’t sure.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","01:03:07"
"President Trump","That’s right.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","01:03:16"
"Savannah Guthrie","There are people who want to know why they should give you a second chance and how you might improve in a second term. 30 seconds. What would you say to them?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","01:03:17"
"President Trump","Because I’ve done a great job. We have the strongest economy in the world. We closed it up. We are coming around the corner. The vaccines are coming out soon, and our economy is strong. We are at a level with jobs like we’ve never been before. We’ve rebuilt our military. We’ve rebuilt our borders. We had no borders. We had no nothing. We’ve rebuilt so much. We’ve given you the greatest tax cut in the history of our country. Greatest regulation cut, equally as important. And we created new levels of jobs that nobody thought was possible. And next year is going to be better than ever before.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","01:03:25"
"Savannah Guthrie","I got to leave it there. I got a wrap from the control room. Mr. President, thank you for your time.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","01:04:00"

"Savannah Guthrie","Thank you for listening to the voters’ questions. That concludes our town hall. We do want to thank the president again, as well as our audience in hot Miami, and all of you watching at home. And a reminder, Donald Trump and Joe Biden are scheduled to meet in person a week from tonight in Nashville, a second and final presidential debate, moderated by our own Kristen Welker. Have a good evening, and thanks for being with us.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-nbc-town-hall-transcript-october-15","Donald Trump NBC Town Hall Transcript October 15","01:04:06"
