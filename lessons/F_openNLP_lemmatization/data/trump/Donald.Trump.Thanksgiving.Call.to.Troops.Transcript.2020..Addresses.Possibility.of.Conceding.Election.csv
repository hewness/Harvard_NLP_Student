"Donald Trump","Today I want to recognize Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Redhair and the United States Army 36th Infantry Division. Tremendous people. From your base in Kuwait, you support our fight against radical Islamic terrorism and help combat Iranian aggression. We salute you. Thank you very much. And you’ll say, perhaps, a few words in a little while. We appreciate it very much, Timothy.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","00:00"
"Donald Trump","From the Marines, we have Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force based in Kuwait which conducts crisis response throughout the Middle-East. Colonel Andrew Priddy, your warriors bring the fight straight to the enemy so that American families can sleep soundly at home. We’ve been building up our military. We spent $2.5 trillion in the last three and a half years, and we’ve never had anything like it in terms of equipment and all of the elements that we put together. Space Force, we’re very proud of. Brand new. Nobody thought that could happen.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","00:28"
"Donald Trump","So we spent 2.5.. Think of that, $2.5 trillion. All new tanks and missiles, and rockets and everything is tippy top. Nobody thought we could ever get there and we’ve done it quickly. Most of the equipment is there. Much of it is there. Most of it’s coming. The rest of it’s coming in over the next, I would say, six months to 12 months. All made in the USA, which is very good. But every American owes you a debt of thanks, and we appreciate it. Also with us are our men and women of the US Navy aboard the USS Winston Churchill. It’s a beauty led by commander Timothy Shanley. You’re deployed in the Red Sea where you deter terrorists, defend freedom of navigation and escort ships through the Strait of Hormuz. Your magnificent ship is a powerful symbol of peace through strength.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","01:05"
"Donald Trump","And that’s what we have now is peace through strength. You look at what’s going on, no wars. They’re saying, “Wow, the president. Four years, no wars.” We stopped the wars and we won, as you know, 100% of the ISIS caliphate in Syria, Iraq. We’ve done a job. Welcome as well to everyone at Ali Al Salaam Airbase in Kuwait, including major Tommy Rutherford and the 386 expeditionary logistics readiness squadron. Thank you very much, Tommy. Your mission to support our soldiers on the ground and deliver precious cargo where it needs to go, including transporting 18 tons of medical equipment during the China virus pandemic. Keep up the outstanding work. Great job you’ve done. I hear all about it. Amazing work you do. From the United States Space… This is a very important thing to me, the Space Force, because it’s 75 years since the Air Force. This is the first one, new branch.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","01:59"
"Donald Trump","The United States Space Force. We’re joined by Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Lomeyer and the 11th Space Warning Squadron… That sounds great, at Buckley Air Force Base in Colorado. You keep watch around the world to detect missile launches, space launches, and nuclear detonations while providing critical intelligence. All of you are pioneers in the newest branch of our armed forces. And again, it’s very special to me, that new branch, because that was something I felt was necessary. And I never said it during a campaign, I said it after I became president. I saw what was happening with China and Russia and others. And it’s really something, so we’re very proud of it. Finally, we have with us members of the US Coast Guard Port Security Unit 308 under Captain General Rocco [inaudible 00:03:59]. You’re joined with us from Guantanamo Bay where you secure our coastal waters, combat drug traffickers, escort vessels, and protect our forces in the region. On American shores and beyond, the Coast Guard has always made America proud.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","03:08"
"Donald Trump","I want to tell you, I was here two years ago in Texas. You saved thousands and thousands of people. That was incredible. The job the Coast Guard has done. And now we have all new ships coming to the Coast Guard. You had old ships, and they were as good as they could be but they were very old. And now you have brand new Coast Guard ships, and it’s my honor to have gotten them for you. Today I send you the love, gratitude, respect, and prayers of our entire nation. Once again, I wish you a very happy Thanksgiving. You’re doing an incredible job and your country is doing well. We just set a record in the stock market, over 30,000 in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Over 30,000, think of that. Nobody ever thought we were going to hit that during a pandemic. The whole world is suffering this tremendous pandemic, not just us. The world.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","04:20"
"Donald Trump","And you wouldn’t know that to listen to the news reports, but the whole world is suffering and we are rounding the curve. The vaccines are being delivered, literally it’ll start next week and the week after. And it’ll hit the frontline workers and seniors and doctors, nurses. A lot of people are going to start, and we’re going very quickly. Two companies already announced. A third one coming up, and a fourth and fifth one coming up soon also. Some people have called it a medical, really, a miracle. Could’ve taken four or five years to do this. Normally it probably would’ve taken four or five years just getting it through the FDA. We pushed it very hard. But I want to thank you all. I want to wish you a happy Thanksgiving. And let’s… Maybe if could start. Anybody would like to raise their hand. Go ahead.

We’ve traveled over 30,000 miles so far through the Atlantic, the Mediterranean, Red Sea, all the way to the Arabian Gulf and back. So we’ve sustained some solid operations out here, conducting escort operations, overwatch, counter-piracy, counter-illicit trafficking.

"Donald Trump","Well, I appreciate it. I love doing it, actually, and I’m very proud of it because we’ve spent so much. When we took over, our military was very depleted. You know that very well.

"Speaker 3","Mr. President, do you have any big plans for your last Thanksgiving in the White House?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","18:33"
"Donald Trump","Well, we don’t know what is last, if you look at what’s going on. You have to really take a look at what’s going on. They’re finding tremendous discrepancies in the votes. Nobody believes those numbers. Those numbers are incorrect numbers. A lot of numbers have already been reported that’s incorrect.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","18:37"
"Donald Trump","You’re going to see things happening over the next week or two that are going to be shocking to people. If you look at the numbers in Michigan, if you look at the numbers in Pennsylvania, if you look at fraudulent voting and fraudulent votes, so I can’t say what’s first and what’s last in terms of is this the last one or is this the first one of a second term. We’ll see what happens. Nobody wants to see the kind of fraud that this election has really come to represent.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","18:55"
"Donald Trump","We are looking at things that are so bad in Georgia, they don’t want to show us signatures. The reason they don’t want to show us signatures is very simple, because we will find thousands and thousands… it’s a very close race. It’s hair-thin. But we’ll find thousands and thousands of discrepancies, fraud. Why they aren’t wanting to show those signatures is amazing. They’re doing recounts, and even in the recount they found thousands of votes that were off. But now we want to look at the signatures, and you will find tens of thousands of false ballots, forged ballots. You’ll see it all over. You’re going to see a lot of it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","19:25"
"Donald Trump","And you go to Pennsylvania, you saw the meeting we had yesterday with Pennsylvania. You saw people come up, they went to vote, and they said, “No, you can’t vote. Somebody else already sent in a ballot, and a woman…” But this is happening tens of thousands of times. I think it was 600 and some-odd thousand, 687,000 fraudulent votes cast in Pennsylvania, and I will tell you, if you look at the state house now, the Republican state house, they’re starting to see what’s going on there. But they’ve really known it for a long time.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","20:04"
"Donald Trump","Then you go to Michigan and you look at what happened in Wayne County and Detroit. I went through a list. I went almost every county and you see it, almost everybody, 78%, 72%, 68% going through the list. Then you get to Wayne, and something happened, tremendous numbers. You saw the canvassers that refused to sign their document because they said, “We can’t sign a fraudulent document.” Horrible things went on. That’s in Wayne County, Detroit. But you look at the votes that were just tabulated, and they were left today. Look at all the counties. I won almost all of them except Detroit was so egregious. It was phony.Look at what’s going on in Wisconsin. Wisconsin they’re finding tremendous discrepancy. You just take a look at that, tremendous discrepancy, and elsewhere. So we’re going to see what happens. But you can’t have somebody assume office and already they want to get rid of America First. I mean they want to get rid of America First. They don’t want America First. You know why? Because China doesn’t want it. China expressed their wish, “Please get rid of America First,” and the Biden administration said, “That’s okay, we’ll get rid of American First.” No, we don’t want to get rid of America First. We want to put America first, and other countries should put themselves first too, and I tell them that all the time. But we don’t want to get rid of it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","20:36"
"Donald Trump","So I don’t know what is going to happen. I know one thing, Joe Biden did not get 80 million votes, and I got 74 million. But there were many ballots thrown away, so I got much more than that. But I got 74 million. 74 million is 11 million more than I got last time. It’s millions more than Ronald Regan got when he won 49 states. I guess he won 49 states, yes, and it’s millions more than Hillary Clinton got. Joe Biden did not get… and by the way, Joe Biden did not beat Barack Obama with the Black vote, didn’t beat him. But they have him as beating him.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","22:00"
"Donald Trump","And if you look at the numbers, the numbers are false. The numbers are corrupt. It was a rigged election, 100%, and people know it. That’s why you have people marching all over the United States right now. They know it was a rigged election and look at what’s happening in Georgia. A lot of things are being found in Georgia and they are absolutely against showing… I mean it’s a sad thing. They don’t want to show signatures. It can be solved if you show signatures. But you’re going to find out the people that signed aren’t the people that are supposed to be signing. You’re going to find that the people that signed those envelopes, they didn’t do the ballots, envelopes… and then somebody said, “Maybe the envelopes were thrown out.” There’s tremendous fraud here.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","22:43"
"Donald Trump","If you look [crosstalk 00:23:28] wait, just one second. If you look at 10:00 in the evening, you saw what happened. Then you had these massive dumps. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it. You have Dominion, which is very, very suspect to start off with. Nobody knows the ownership. People say the votes are counted in foreign countries and much worse than that, by the way, with Dominion. So Dominion is also partially based in Canada, but it’s based in other countries too, and nobody knows where the votes… But you know, Canada refuses to use Dominion. Canada uses paper ballots. So think of it, they’re based in Canada, and Canada refused-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","23:27"
"Donald Trump","Think of it. They’re based in Canada and Canada refuses to use them. They’re smart. They use paper ballots because paper ballots are, frankly, the only thing that really you’re going to get an accurate tab on because those machines are fixed, they’re rigged. You can press Trump and the vote goes to Biden. All you have to do is play with a chip, and it’s shown all the time. All you have to do is play with a chip, and they played with a chip, especially in Wayne County and Detroit. You take a look. In Philadelphia, you take a look. We’ve had excellent meetings with senators from Pennsylvania, Republican senators and others, and they’re seeing things. They knew it was dishonest, but they didn’t know it was this dishonest. You’ll see it all. You’ll see it also, so we’ll see. Speaking of Georgia, I’ll be going there.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","24:03"

"Donald Trump","I spoke with the two great senators. They’re great senators, Kelly and David. I’ll probably be going on Saturday. We’re looking for a site. We’re going to have a tremendous turnout, and we seem to always have a good turnout. The people are very disappointed that we were robbed. We were robbed. I won that by hundreds of thousands of votes. Everybody knows it. You go down the streets, there are Trump/Pence signs all over the place. We won that by hundreds of thousands, Georgia, so they’re disappointed. I don’t want them to be disappointed. That’ll solve itself. We’re finding the votes. Once we get to the signatures, we’ll take over 100%. Once we get to signature, 100%. We will take over Georgia and we will get Georgia, but they have to show us the signatures. Stacey Abrams pulled the wool over the secretary of state. I don’t know who he is, but the secretary of state.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","24:55"

"Donald Trump","It doesn’t matter. He says that, too, but I don’t know him. I never met him. I have no idea who he is. All I know is that’s the ultimate. “I donated to Trump. I respect Trump. I love Trump. I think Trump is great. By the way, we’re giving nothing.” This guy got played like I’ve never seen anybody played. Tell him, if he donated to Trump, if he likes Trump, let us see the signatures. Why is he not letting us see? There’s only one reason you can’t see the signatures. That’s because there’s fraud all over the place. Even without looking at signatures, as you know, we found thousands of wrong votes. By the way, always against me. It was not 50/50. It was always against me.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","25:46"
"Donald Trump","The other thing, take a look at Michigan. Take a look at what they did with respect to counties, every county, 78%, 72%, 76%, 59%. The whole thing, one after another after another, and then you get to Detroit and it’s more votes than people. Dead people voting all over the place. But anyway, going back to Georgia just for a second. I’ll be going there on Saturday night, and maybe I’ll go twice. It’s very important that we win those races. These are two great people. I know them both very well. They’re both great people. I think the two people… I beat the one gentleman. He ran against a congressional candidate who was an excellent person, frankly, and he didn’t even live in the right community, and that’s how we won. Now I have to beat him again. He lost as a congressman. He was going for Congress, as you remember, and now against Karen. And now he’s running against David. He doesn’t deserve to be there. He’s a lightweight. The other one is either a communist or a socialist. I can’t figure that one out yet. But he’s either a communist or socialist, probably a communist. This is not for Georgia. I just want to tell my people, don’t be disappointed yet because this race is far from over. But I’m going on Saturday night. I’ll be in Georgia. We’re going to have a tremendous crowd. They’re looking for the right site. Probably, we’d love to take one of the big stadiums, but you can’t because of the COVID, so we’ll have an outdoor form of probably an airport. Most likely it’s an airport. They’re looking for the biggest space. We’ll have tens of thousands of people show up. I think it’s very important. Then, I may go a second time. Depending on how they’re doing, I may go a second time. But they’re two really good people. Yeah?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","26:23"

"Donald Trump","As to whether or not I can get this apparatus moving this quickly, because time isn’t on our side, everything else is on our side. Facts are on our side. This was a massive fraud. This should never take place in this country. We’re like a third world country. We have machines that nobody knows what the hell they’re looking at. You take a look at all the mistakes they made. Look at even Georgia. Look at all the mistakes they made, and all that was is a simple you press a button. Look at Georgia. All the votes they found just by going… And I said they shouldn’t even do it because it doesn’t mean anything. They’re doing a recount right now in Georgia that is meaningless.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","28:32"
"Donald Trump","The only recount that matters in Georgia is to look at the signatures on the envelope, and you will find that those signatures do not match the people that were, many of them, hundreds of thousands of them, hundreds of thousands, and I only lost by 12,000 votes. I didn’t lose. I don’t even like to say I lose. I guess we’re 11,000 or 12,000 votes short. That’s out of millions and millions of votes. They just got it over the line. One of the things that happened, I did so well, and I was told this in two other states, that they didn’t know what to do. They panicked. Take a look at their drops at 3:00 and 3:42 in the morning on certain states. They did drops where you’re going along like this, and then you’ll have a spike that goes up to the ceiling at that. It’s disgraceful.

"Donald Trump","I will tell you, in Philadelphia, the Republicans, State House Republicans are very, very upset, and it’s appropriate because Philadelphia’s become very activist, if you look at what’s going on.

"Donald Trump","Certainly I will. Certainly I will, and you know that. But I think that there will be a lot of things happening between now and the 20th of January, a lot of things. Massive fraud has been found. We’re like a third world country. We’re using computer equipment that can be hacked. They talk about glitches. How many glitches did they find? A glitch, oh gee, we had a glitch, 5,000 votes. In all cases, right? In all cases, the votes went from Trump to Biden. They didn’t go from Biden. The glitches were never from Biden to Trump. They had many glitches, and they said, “Oh, we had a glitch.” A glitch is like the equipment is a little broken, we’ll fix it up. No, a glitch is, in this case, we caught them cheating, we caught them stealing, we caught a fraudulent effort to get votes, and they said, “Oh yes, it’s true, there was.” And there were many of them. But here’s the problem. There were probably 10, 20, 30 times that didn’t get caught. We just got lucky and caught numerous of them.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","31:16"
"Donald Trump","What that is, is very simple. If you look at the glitch, the glitch means, “Oh, we got caught. We got caught with the votes and now let’s just call it a glitch.” It wasn’t the machinery. By the way, the machinery, if you look, just take a look anywhere on the internet, you will see many, many people where they’re experimenting with this stupid machinery, where if you set it a certain way, the votes go from Trump to Biden. If you look at these counties, if you look at Arizona where I was going to win very easily, I’ve had the biggest politicians in Arizona say, “There was no way you lost Arizona.” There’s no way I lost Pennsylvania, with his anti-fuel and with his anti-fracking and all of the things that they stand against. There was no way.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","32:20"
"Donald Trump","Now, Texas, you all said that I was going to lose Texas by a lot, four points. I won Texas by eight or nine points. Right? I won it very easily. In Wisconsin, you all said I was going to lose, or the poll said, certain polls, Washington Post, ABC, said I was going to lose by 17 points. Think of how dishonest. I thought I was going to win it, and essentially I did win it. It’s very, very close. It’s very, very close. We’re going to win because they found, by the way, in Wisconsin, they have found massive discrepancy, just so you understand, massive discrepancy. But they said I was going to lose by 17 points and I won the state, but it’s very close. It shows very close, whether you say win or lose, it shows very close.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","33:12"
"Donald Trump","When you look at the massive discrepancy that we’ll be revealing, that’s already been revealed, everybody knows it, they just don’t want to play it. Between big tech and the fake news media, you just put out like this little railroad trade. Now, I think it’s not right that he’s trying to pick a cabinet, but I can’t imagine whether it’s courts or legislatures. If you’re going to catch hundreds of thousands of false ballots, and I’m talking in each state. Just so you understand, many, many more votes that we’re talking about that we need, you understand, I’m not saying we caught 23 dead people, but we were short 20,000 votes. No, no. We have tens of thousands votes more than we need in all cases. Okay? In all cases. I think you’re going to see something. I think it’s going to be a very big story.

You’re going to find tremendous fraud. You’re going to find fraud of hundreds of thousands of votes per state. You’re going to find fraud of many, many times the votes that I need. Again, we’re not talking about less votes where 20 votes, but it doesn’t turn the election. No, we’re talking about thousands and thousands of votes beyond what we need to turn a state. When you see that, I think it’s very hard, even for the media to say that Biden should win the state.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","35:08"

"Donald Trump","Well, I told them today, I think you’re dealing in a very fraudulent system. I think I’m very worried about that. They are tremendous people. Kelly Loeffler, David Perdue are tremendous people. They should be in the United States Senate. They’re desperately needed. But I told them today, I said, “Listen, you have a fraudulent system. You have a system with the flick of a switch or the putting in of a new chip can change the course of history, and you have to be very careful.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","36:32"
"Donald Trump","I read this morning where Stacey Abrams has 850,000 ballots accumulated. Now, that’s called harvesting. You’re not allowed to harvest, but I understand the Secretary of State who is really, he’s an enemy of the people. The Secretary of State, and whether he’s Republican or not, this man, what he’s done, supposedly he made a deal, and you’ll have to check this, where she’s allowed to harvest, but in other areas they’re not allowed. What kind of a deal is that? They’re not allowed to harvest during the presidential.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","37:01"
"Donald Trump","But how can she say she has 850,000 ballots? That would mean that she’s got 850,000 ballots for her. That’s not supposed to be happening. That’s not an election. You know, an election should be a one day deal. You walk in and you vote. And if you can’t do it, if for some reason you’re not feeling well or there’s a problem… But what they did is they used COVID in order to defraud the people of this country. And the whole world is watching, and the whole world is laughing at our electoral process. The whole world is watching, and it’s a very sad thing, a very sad thing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","37:35"
"Donald Trump","And you know what? I’ve done a lot of things. You just saw Space Force, and you’ve seen the tax cuts, and the regulation cuts, and the way we’ve taken care of the vets, and what we’ve done with Anwar and Alaska and all the different things we’ve done, more than just about anybody’s done, even though it’s four years. There are those that say what I’m doing right now is the single most important thing I’ve ever done, and I think it may be true. It may be true. The vaccines, and by the way, don’t let Joe Biden take credit for the vaccines. If Joe Biden… Joe Biden failed with the swine flu, H1N1. Totally failed with the swine flu. Don’t let him take credit for the vaccines because the vaccines were me and I pushed people harder than they’ve ever been pushed before. And we got that approved and through, and nobody’s ever seen anything like it. And you got a big resistance in the FDA from years and years of people working there for years and years, different administrations. But the vaccines, there are those that says one of the greatest things. It’s a medical miracle. Don’t let anyone try and take credit for it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","38:12"
"Donald Trump","But with all of the things I’ve done, this could be the most important because there’s been voter fraud going on, but never at this scale. Tens of millions of ballots have been sent out to people that didn’t even want them. Many people, and I know you’ve heard, many people have received two, three, and four ballots, and many people have taken those two, three, and four ballots and they’ve voted them.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","39:19"
"Donald Trump","This election was a fraud. It was a rigged election. I mean, I hate to say it, but this was rigged, at the highest level, it was a rigged election. So we have to figure it out.

"Donald Trump","And I’ll go a step further. I said today, other than the fact that you have all of the eyes and ears, but the media doesn’t cover it properly because the media, if they saw something wrong, I’m convinced that media would not report it because you have many things that you know are wrong and you don’t report. But if the media was honest in this country, which, for the most part, they’re not, this would never have happened. This has taken place. This fraud has taken place.

You have a woman or somebody announced 850,000 absentee ballots have already been collected. 850, and I told David Perdue today, and I told Kelly yesterday, I said, “They’re talking about having collected already 800,000 ballots against you.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-thanksgiving-call-to-troops-transcript-2020-addresses-possibility-of-conceding-election","Donald Trump Thanksgiving Call to Troops Transcript 2020: Addresses Possibility of Conceding Election","40:37"

If the media were honest and if big tech were honest, which it’s totally not, it’s a terrible thing. That whole Section 230 is a disgrace that they even have it. But big tech is totally dishonest. If the media were honest and big tech was fair, this wouldn’t even be a contest, and I would have won by a tremendous amount, a tremendous amount. And I did win by a tremendous amount, but it hasn’t been reported yet. But people understand what’s happened. They know what happened.
