"Chris Wallace","Good evening from the Thomas & Mack Center at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. I’m Chris Wallace of Fox News. And I welcome you to the third and final of the 2016 presidential debates between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The commission has designed the format, six, roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to those rules. For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic. None of those questions has been shared with the commission or the two candidates. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent, no cheers, boos, or other interruptions so we and you can focus on what the candidates have to say. No noise, except right now, as we welcome the Democratic nominee for president, Secretary Clinton, and the Republican nominee for president, Mr. Trump,","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","00:08"
"Chris Wallace","Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, welcome. Let’s get right to it. The first topic is the Supreme Court. You both talked briefly about the Court in the last debate, but I want to drill down on this because the next president will almost certainly have at least one appointment and likely or possibly two or three appointments, which means that you will in effect determine the balance of the Court for what could be the next quarter-century. First of all, where do you want to see the Court take the country? And secondly, what’s your view on how the Constitution should be interpreted? Do the Founders’ words mean what they say, or is it a living document to be applied flexibly according to changing circumstances? In this segment, Secretary Clinton, you go first. You have two minutes.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:28"
"Hillary Clinton","Thank you very much, Chris. And thanks to UNLV for hosting us. I think when we talk about the Supreme Court it really raises the central issue in this election. Namely, what kind of country are we going to be? What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens? What kind of rights will Americans have? And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy. For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women’s rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","02:18"
"Hillary Clinton","I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court. But I feel that at this point in our country’s history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United. We stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say the Supreme Court should represent all of us. That’s how I see the Court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the Court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans. And I look forward to having that opportunity. I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them. That’s the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate. The president nominates and then the Senate advises and consents or not, but they go forward with the process.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","03:19"
"Chris Wallace","Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, same question. Where do you want to see the Court take the country on how do you believe the Constitution should be interpreted?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","04:26"
"Donald Trump","Well, first of all, it’s great to be with you and thank you, everybody. The Supreme Court, it’s what it’s all about our country is so … It’s just so imperative that we have the right justices. Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent, and she was forced to apologize and apologize she did. But these were statements that should never, ever have been made. We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion, is going to uphold the Second Amendment and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege. I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don’t think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment, which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now. But I feel that it’s absolutely important that we uphold because of the fact that it is under such trauma.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","04:36"
"Donald Trump","I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint and I’ve named 20 of them, the justices that I’m going to appoint will be pro-life. They will have a conservative bent. They will be protecting the Second Amendment. They are great scholars, in all cases, and are people of tremendous respect. They will interpret the Constitution the way the Founders wanted it interpreted and I believe that’s very, very important. I don’t think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear. It’s all about the Constitution of … And so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be. And those are the people that I will appoint.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","05:38"
"Chris Wallace","Mr. Trump, thank you. We now have about 10 minutes for an open discussion. I want to focus on two issues that in fact, by the justices that you name could end up changing the existing law of the land. First is one that you mentioned Mr. Trump, and that is guns. Secretary Clinton, you said last year, and let me quote, “The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment.” And now, in fact, in the 2008 Heller case, the Court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms but a right that is reasonably limited. Those were the words of the judge, Antonin Scalia who wrote the decision. What’s wrong with that?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","06:28"
"Hillary Clinton","Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment. I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years. I represented upstate New York. I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership. It goes back to the founding of our country. But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation. Because I support the Second Amendment doesn’t mean that I want people who shouldn’t have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family. And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns. I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","07:08"
"Hillary Clinton","There’s other matters that I think are sensible, that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment. You mentioned the Heller decision, and what I was saying that you referenced Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the Court applied the Second Amendment in that case because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns. And so they wanted people with guns to safely store them. And the Court didn’t accept that reasonable regulation, but they’ve accepted many others. So I see no conflict between saving people’s lives and defending the Second Amendment.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","07:52"
"Chris Wallace","Let me bring Mr. Trump in here. The bipartisan Open Debate Coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here and this was in fact, one of the top questions that they got. How will you ensure the Second Amendment is protected? You just heard Secretary Clinton’s answer. Does she persuade you that while you may disagree on regulation, that in fact, she supports a Second Amendment right to bear arms?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","08:35"
"Donald Trump","Well, the DC versus Heller decision was very strongly and she was extremely angry about it. I watched. I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld. And Justice Scalia was so involved and it was a well-crafted decision, but Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry, and people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","09:00"
"Chris Wallace","Let me bring in Secretary Clinton. Were you extremely upset?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","09:25"
"Hillary Clinton","Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes take appropriate precautions. But there’s no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there’s an individual right to bear arms. That is not in conflict with sensible common-sense regulation. And look, I understand that Donald’s been strongly supported by the NRA, the gun lobby is on his side, they’re running millions of dollars of ads against me. And I regret that because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say, “Of course, we’re going to protect and defend the Second Amendment, but we’re going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","09:28"
"Chris Wallace","Let me bring Mr. Trump back into that because, in fact, you oppose any limits on assault weapons, any limits on high capacity magazines, you support a national right to carry law. Why, sir?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","10:23"
"Donald Trump","Well, let me just tell you before we go any further, in Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city. So we have the toughest laws and you have tremendous gun violence. I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment. And I am, I don’t know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I’m very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA and it’s the earliest endorsement they’ve ever given to anybody who ran for president. So I’m very honored by all of that. We are going to appoint justices, this is the best way to help the Second Amendment, we are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","10:37"
"Chris Wallace","Well, let’s pick up on another issue which divides you, and the justices, whoever ends up winning this election of points, could have a dramatic effect there, and that’s the issue of abortion.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","11:23"

"Chris Wallace","Mr. Trump, you’re pro-life. But I want to ask you specifically, do you want the Court, including the justices that you will name to overturn Roe v. Wade, which includes in fact, states a woman’s right to abortion?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","11:36"
"Donald Trump","Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","11:50"

"Chris Wallace","But what I’m asking you, sir, is, do you want to see the Court overturn? You just said you want to see the Court protect the Second Amendment. Do you want to see the Court overturn Roe v. Wade?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","12:02"
"Donald Trump","Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that will happen, and that’ll happen automatically in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the Court. I will say this, it will go back to the states and the states will then make a determination.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","12:11"

"Hillary Clinton","Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult in many cases, decisions about her healthcare that one can imagine. And in this case, it’s not only about Roe v. Wade. It is about what’s happening right now in America. So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country. Donald has said he’s in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood, even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood. I will defend Planned Parenthood. I will defend Roe v. Wade. And I will defend women’s rights to make their own healthcare decisions.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","12:30"

"Hillary Clinton","We have come too far to have that turned back now. And indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions, and I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","13:27"
"Chris Wallace","I’m going to give you a chance to respond. But I want to ask you, Secretary Clinton, I want to explore how far you believe the right to abortion goes. You have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights. You also voted against a ban on late-term partial-birth abortions. Why?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","13:43"
"Hillary Clinton","Because Roe V Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account. And when I voted as a Senator, I did not think that that was the case. The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make. I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy, get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term, or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy. I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions. So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","14:03"
"Chris Wallace","Mr. Trump, your reaction, and particularly on this issue of late-term partial-birth abortion.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","15:03"
"Donald Trump","Well, I think it’s terrible. If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby. Now, you can say that that’s okay. And Hillary can say that that’s okay, but it’s not okay with me because based on what she’s saying and based on where she’s going and where she’s been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month, on the final day. And that’s not acceptable.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","15:07"
"Hillary Clinton","Well, that is not what happens in these cases. And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate. You should meet with some of the women that I’ve met with, women I’ve known over the course of my life. This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make. And I do not believe the government should be making it. I’ve had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country. I’ve been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions like they used to do in China or forced women to bear children like they used to do in Romania. And I can tell you, the government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice. And I will stand up for that right.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","15:40"

"Chris Wallace","All right. Let’s move on to the subject of immigration. And there is almost no issue that separates the two of you more than the issue of immigration. Actually, there are a lot of issues that separate the two of you. Mr. Trump, you want to build a wall. Secretary Clinton, you have offered no specific plan for how you want to secure our southern border. Mr. Trump, you are calling for major deportations. Secretary Clinton, you say that within your first hundred days as president, you’re going to offer a package that includes a pathway to citizenship. The question really is why are you right and your opponent wrong?

"Donald Trump","Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that waiting in line for many, many years. We need strong borders. In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of, I mean, these are unbelievable people that I’ve gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally. You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country. They’re coming in illegally. Drugs are pouring in through the border. We have no country if we have no border.

"Donald Trump","As you know, the border patrol agents, 16,500 plus ICE last week endorsed me. First time they’ve ever endorsed a candidate. It means their job is tougher, but they know what’s going on. They know it better than anybody. They want strong borders. They feel we have to have strong borders. I was up in New Hampshire the other day, the biggest complaint they have, it’s with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama, all of the problems, their single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern borders, just pouring and destroying their youth. It’s poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","17:56"
"Donald Trump","We have to have strong borders. We have to keep the drugs out of our country. Right now, we’re getting the drugs, they’re getting the cash. We need strong borders. We need absolute. We cannot give amnesty. Now, I want to build the wall. We need the wall and the border patrol, ICE, they all want the wall. We stop the drugs. We shore up the border. One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones. We have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out. We’re going to get them out. We’re going to secure the border. And once the border is secured at a later date, we’ll make a determination as to the rest. But we have some bad hombres here and we’re going to get them out.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","18:34"
"Chris Wallace","Mr. Trump, thank you. Same question to you, Secretary Clinton, basically, why are you right and Mr. Trump is wrong?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","19:16"
"Hillary Clinton","Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who was very worried that her parents might be deported because she was born in this country, but they were not. They work hard. They do everything they can to give her a good life. And you’re right, I don’t want to rip families apart. I don’t want to be sending parents away from children. I don’t want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country. We have 11 million undocumented people. They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people. He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix, that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","19:23"
"Hillary Clinton","Now here’s what that means. It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home, to home, business, to business, rounding up people who are undocumented, and we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country. I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation. I think it’s an idea that would rip our country apart. I have been for border security for years. I voted for border security in the United States Senate, and my comprehensive immigration reform plan, of course, includes border security. But I want to put our resources where I think they’re most needed. Getting rid of any violent person, anybody who should be deported, we should deport them.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","20:09"
"Hillary Clinton","When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president, didn’t even raise it. He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said, “We’re not paying for that wall.” So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly. And that’s why I’m introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first hundred days with a path to citizenship.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","21:02"

"Donald Trump","Chris, I think I should respond to that. First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico, a very nice man. We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals, believe me. The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind signed by anybody. It’s a disaster.

"Hillary Clinton","There are some limited places where that was appropriate. There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that. But it is clear when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants, rapists, and criminals, and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants. Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good because then employers can’t exploit them and undercut Americans’ wages. And Donald knows a lot about this. He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower. He underpaid undocumented workers and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do, “You complain, I’ll get you deported.” I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts.

And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country. She won’t even mention the words and neither will President Obama. So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders. Now, we can talk about Putin. I don’t know Putin. He said nice things about me. If we got along well, that would be good if Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good. He has no respect for her. He has no respect for our president.

We’re going to drill down into this a little bit more, but in this overview, please explain to me why you believe that your plan will create more jobs and growth for this country and your opponent’s plan will not.

"Hillary Clinton","Well, I think when the middle-class thrives America thrives. And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities. I want us to have the biggest jobs programs since World War II, jobs and infrastructure, and advanced manufacturing. I think we can compete with high wage countries, and I believe we should. New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses. I want us to do more to help small business. That’s where two thirds of the new jobs are going to come from. I want us to raise the national minimum wage because people who live in poverty who work full-time should not still be in poverty. And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.

And for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted. And we’re going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is. Most of the gains in the last years, since the Great Recession, have gone to the very top.

Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle down economics on steroids.

And she can say all she wants about college tuition. And I’m a big proponent. We’re going to do a lot of things for college tuition, but the rest of the public’s going to be paying for it. We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton’s plan. But I’d like to start off where we left. Because when I said Japan and Germany, and I’m not to single them out, but South Korea, those are very rich, powerful countries. Saudi Arabia, nothing but money. We protect Saudi Arabia.

And I’ve been given a lot of credit for it. All of a sudden, they’re starting to pay up, they have to pay up. We’re protecting people. They have to pay up. And I’m a big fan of NATO, but they have to pay up. She comes out and said, “We love our allies. We think our allies are great.” Well, it’s awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying, “We think how great they are.” We have to tell Japan in a very nice way. We have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, “You have to help us out.” We have during his regime, during President Obama’s regime, we’ve doubled our national debt.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","36:56"
"Donald Trump","We’re up to $20 trillion. So my plan, we’re going to renegotiate trade deals. We’re going to have a lot of free trade. We’re going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now. But we have horrible deals. Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA. One of the worst deals ever, our jobs are being sucked out of our economy. You look at all of the places that I just left. You go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them. You go upstate New York. Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","37:37"
"Donald Trump","We’re bringing our jobs back. I am going to renegotiate NAFTA. And if I can’t make a great deal, then we’re going to terminate NAFTA. And we’re going to create new deals. We’re going to have trade, but we’re going to terminate it. We’re going to make a great trade deal. And if we can’t, we’re going to do it. We’re going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster. We are going to cut taxes massively. We’re going to cut business taxes massively. They’re going to start hiring people. We’re going to bring the $2.5 trillion that’s offshore back into the country. We are going to start the engine rolling again, because right now our country is dying at 1% GDP.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","38:05"

"Hillary Clinton","… the fact is he’s going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we’ve ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration. I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign, I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less. I also will not add a penny to the debt. I have costed out what I’m going to do. He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt. Well, he mentioned the debt. We know how to get control of the debt. When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus. And we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","38:45"
"Hillary Clinton","When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression, he has cut the deficit by two thirds. So yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs, is by investing in people. So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead. That’s the kind of approach that will work. Cutting taxes on the wealthy, we’ve tried that. It has not worked the way that it has been promised.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","39:27"

"Hillary Clinton","Well, it’s a combination, Chris. And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch and go situation. I was in the Senate before I became Secretary of State. I’ve never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy. I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy. He doesn’t get the credit.

"Hillary Clinton","So now we’ve dug ourselves out of it. We’re standing, but we’re not yet running. So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out, and the ground up, not the top down. That is not going to work. That’s why what I have put forward doesn’t add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher paying jobs. We’re beginning to see some increase in incomes. And we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs. We’ve got to do more to get the whole economy moving. And that’s what I believe I will be able to do.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","41:14"

We are growing, our last report came out, and it’s right around the 1% level. And I think it’s going down last week. As you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report, terrible jobs report. In fact, I said, “Is that the last jobs report before the election? Because of it is, I should win easily.” It was so bad. The report was so bad. Look, our country is stagnant. We’ve lost our jobs. We’ve lost our businesses. We’re not making things anymore, relatively speaking. Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world. I’ve visited so many communities.

Now, she can say that her husband did well, but boy did they suffer as NAFTA kicked in, because it didn’t really kick in very much, but it kicked in after they left. Boy, did they suffer. That was one of the worst things that’s ever been signed by our country. Now, she wants to sign trans Pacific partnership. And she wants it.

Does it create jobs, raise incomes, and further our national security? I’m against it now. I’ll be against it after the election. I’ll be against it when I’m President. There’s only one of us on this stage, who’s actually shipped jobs to Mexico, because that’s Donald. He’s shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico, but he mentioned China.

In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel. So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is, but he has given jobs to Chinese steel workers, not American steel workers. That’s the kind of approach that is just not going to work. We’re going to pull the country together. We’re going to have trade agreements that we enforce.

I say the one thing you have over me is experience, but it’s bad experience. Because what you’ve done has turned out badly. For 30 years, you’ve been in a position to help. And if you say that I use steel or I use something else, make it impossible for me to do that. I wouldn’t mind. The problem is you talk, but you don’t get anything done, Hillary. You don’t. Just like when you ran the state department, $6 billion was missing. How do you miss $6 billion? You ran the state department, $6 billion was either stolen, they don’t know. It’s gone. $6 billion.

He raised the 30 years of experience. So let me just talk briefly about that. Back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children’s Defense Fund and I was taking on discrimination against African-American kids in schools. He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings. In the 1980s, I was working to reform the schools in Arkansas.

So I’m happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I’ve done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families, get ahead and stay ahead with your 30 years, and I’ll let the American people make that decision.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","46:54"

Why would so many different women from so many different circumstances over so many different years, why would they all in this last couple of weeks, make up, you denied this, why would they all make up these stories?

She’s the one, and Obama, that caused the violence. They hired people, they paid them $1,500 and they’re on tape saying, “Be violent, cause fights, do bad things.” I would say the only way, because those stories are all totally false, I have to say that. And I didn’t even apologize to my wife who’s sitting right here because I didn’t do anything. I didn’t know any of these women. I didn’t see these women. These women, the woman on the plane, the woman… I think they want either fame or her campaign did it.

He went after John McCain, a prisoner of war, said he prefers people who aren’t captured. He went after a federal judge, born in Indiana, but who Donald said couldn’t be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican. So it’s not one thing. This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness of a very dark, and in many ways dangerous vision of our country.

"Chris Wallace","In this bucket about fitness to be president, there’s been a lot of developments over the last 10 days since the last debate. I’d like to ask you about them. These are questions that the American people have. Secretary Clinton, during your 2009 Senate confirmation hearing, you promised to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest with your dealing with the Clinton Foundation while you were Secretary of State, but emails show that donors got special access to you. Those seeking grants for Haiti relief were considered separately from non-donors. And some of those donors got government contracts, taxpayer money. Can you really say that you kept your pledge to that Senate committee and why isn’t what happened and what went on between you and the Clinton Foundation, why isn’t it what Mr. Trump calls pay to play?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","56:09"
"Hillary Clinton","Well, everything I did as Secretary of State was in furtherance of our country’s interests and our values. The State Department has said that. I think that’s been proven. But I am happy, in fact I am thrilled, to talk about the Clinton Foundation because it is a world renowned charity, and I am so proud of the work that it does. I could talk for the rest of the debate. I know I don’t have the time to do that. But just briefly, the Clinton Foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with HIV/AIDS to afford treatment, and that’s about half of all the people in the world who are getting treatment.

You can look at our tax returns, we’ve got them all out there. But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate, he has not paid a penny in federal income tax.

He said the Republican primary was rigged against him. Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering, he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him.

The Iraqi offensive to take back Mosul has begun. If they are successful in pushing ISIS out of that city and out of all of Iraq, the question then becomes what happens the day after? And that’s something that whichever review ends up, whoever of you ends up as President, is going to have to confront. Will you put US troops into that vacuum to make sure that ISIS doesn’t come back or isn’t replaced by something even worse?

But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force. I don’t think that is in our interests. And I don’t think that would be smart to do. In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself. The goal here is to take back Mosul. It’s going to be a hard fight. I’ve got no illusions about that. And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:07:36"
"Hillary Clinton","I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a really successful military operation, but we know we’ve got lots of work to do. Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians continue. So I have said, “Look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS.” That’s why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home. Why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online. Why we have to make sure here at home, we don’t let terrorists buy weapons. If you’re too dangerous to fly, you’re too dangerous to buy a gun. And I’m going to continue to push for a no fly zone and safe havens within Syria, not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to frankly gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:08:26"

"Donald Trump","Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad. We had Mosul, but when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul. Now we’re fighting again to get Mosul. Problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS, who they felt were in Mosul. About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they’re going to attack Mosul. Whatever happened to the element of surprise? Okay. We announce we’re going after Mosul. I’ve been reading about going after Mosul now for about, how long is it Hillary three months? These people have all left. They’ve all left. The element of surprise.

But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it? And the only reason they did it is because she’s running for the office of President and they want to look tough. They want to look good. He violated the red line in the sand and he made so many mistakes, made all mistakes. That’s why we have the great migration. But she wanted to look good for the election. So they’re going in, but who’s going to get Mosul really? We’ll take Mosul eventually. By the way, if you look at what’s happening, much tougher than they thought. Much, much tougher, much more dangerous, going to be more deaths than they thought. But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they’re smart.

A deal that’s going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons, Iran should write us yet another letter saying, “Thank you very much.” Because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq. Something they’ve wanted to do forever, but we’ve made it so easy for them. So we’re now going to take Mosul. And you know who’s going to be the beneficiary? Iran.

"Hillary Clinton","And you can hear the audio of him saying that. Why does that matter? Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position. I guess he believes it makes him look better to contrast with me because I did vote for it. But what’s really important here is to understand all the interplay. Mosul is a Sunni city. Mosul is on the border of Syria, and yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, just like we went after Bin Laden while you were doing Celebrity Apprentice and we brought him to justice. We need to go after the leadership, but we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters. There are several thousand fighters in Mosul. They’ve been digging underground. They’ve been prepared to defend. It’s going to be tough fighting, but I think we can take back Mosul and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:12:42"

And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago. He aligned with Russia. He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful. We gave them $150 billion back.

"Chris Wallace","Secretary Clinton, you have talked about, and in the last debate and again today, that you would impose a no-fly zone to try to protect the people of Aleppo and to stop the killing there. President Obama has refused to do that because he fears it’s going to draw us closer or deeper into the conflict, and General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says you impose a no-fly zone, chances are you’re going to get into a war, his words, with Syria and Russia. So the question I have is, if you impose a no-fly zone, first of all, how do you respond to their concerns? Secondly, if you impose a no-fly zone and a Russian plane violates that, does President Clinton shoot that plane down?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:18:02"
"Hillary Clinton","Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict. I’m well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general. This would not be done just on the first day. This would take a lot of negotiation, and it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground. We’ve had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated, so I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:18:42"
"Hillary Clinton","But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees. He’s made these claims repeatedly. I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in, but I am not going to slam the door on women and children. That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance is haunting, and so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting. That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks. In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born. So let’s be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:19:29"

"Chris Wallace","Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton, no. We need to move on to our final segment, and that is the national debt, which has not been discussed until tonight. Our national debt, as a share of the economy, our GDP, is now 77%. That’s the highest since just after World War II. But the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says, Secretary Clinton, under your plan, debt would rise to 86% of GDP over the next 10 years. Mr. Trump, under your plan, they say it would rise to 105% of GDP over the next 10 years. The question is why are both of you ignoring this problem?

But we’re bringing it from 1% up to 4%. And I actually think we can go higher than 4%. I think you can go to 5% or 6%. And if we do, you don’t have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine. We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again. To do that, we’re taking back jobs. We’re not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don’t make our product anymore.

We’ve had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies. You take these big companies, these trade deals are far bigger than these companies, and yet we don’t use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary, I must say. But we don’t use those people. Those are the people. These are the greatest negotiators in the world. We have the greatest business people in the world. We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals. We use political hacks. We use people that get the position because they made a campaign contribution, and they’re dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are.

"Hillary Clinton","Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is “Make America Great Again,” I wonder when he thought America was great. And before he rushes and says, “Before you and President Obama were there,” I think it’s important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades. Back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world. He was criticizing President Reagan. This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into the middle and says, “I alone can fix it,” as he said on the convention stage.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:23:55"
"Hillary Clinton","But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I’m proposing. I do not add a penny to the national debt. I take that very seriously, because I do think it’s one of the issues we’ve got to come to grips with. So when I talk about how we’re going to pay for education, how we’re going to invest in infrastructure, how we’re going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I’ve made it very clear we are going where the money is. We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share, and there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth. In fact, I think just the opposite. We’ll have what economists call middle-out growth.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:24:49"

So, in effect, the final question I want to ask you in this regard is, and let me start with you, Mr. Trump, would President Trump make a deal to save Medicare and Social Security that included both tax increases and benefit cuts, in effect, a grand bargain on entitlements?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:26:24"
"Donald Trump","I’m cutting taxes. We’re going to grow the economy. It’s going to grow at a record rate of growth.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:27:13"

"Donald Trump","No, it’s going to totally help you. And one thing we have to do: Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. It’s destroying our country. It’s destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses. We have to repeal and replace Obamacare. You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year ’17, it is a disaster. If we don’t repeal and replace … Now, it’s probably going to die of its own weight, but Obamacare has to go. The premiums are going up 60%, 70%, 80%. Next year they’re going to go up over 100%. And I’m really glad that the premiums have started … At least the people see what’s happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can’t get any worse. Bad health care at the most expensive price. We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:27:18"
"Chris Wallace","And, Secretary Clinton, same question, because at this point, Social Security and Medicare are going to run out, the trust funds are going to run out of money. Will you, as president, will you consider a grand bargain, a deal that includes both tax increases and benefit cuts to try to save both programs?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:28:11"
"Hillary Clinton","Well, Chris, I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the Social Security Trust Fund. That’s part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy. My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald’s, assuming he can’t figure out how to get out of it. But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:28:31"

"Hillary Clinton","… by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it. I will not cut benefits. I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system. But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt. That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare. And I’ll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal. The Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund, so if he repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse. What we need to do is go after-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:28:54"

"Hillary Clinton","… the long-term health care drivers. We’ve got to get costs down, increase value, emphasize wellness. I have a plan for doing that. And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:29:40"
"Chris Wallace","This is the final time, probably to both of your delight, that you’re going to be on a stage together in this campaign. I would like to end it on a positive note. You had not agreed to closing statements, but it seems to me in a funny way that might make it more interesting because you haven’t prepared closing statements, so I’d like you each to take, and we’re going to put a clock up, a minute, as the final question in the final debate, to tell the American people why they should elect you to be the next president. This is another new mini-segment. Secretary Clinton, it’s your turn to go first.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:29:56"
"Hillary Clinton","Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I’m reaching out to all Americans, Democrats, Republicans, and independents, because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone. We need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition. I’ve been privileged to see the presidency up close, and I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you. I have made the cause of children and families really my life’s work. That’s what my mission will be in the presidency. I will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations. I will do everything that I can to make sure that you have good jobs with rising incomes, that your kids have good educations from preschool through college. I hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:30:29"

"Donald Trump","She’s raising the money from the people she wants to control. Doesn’t work that way. But when I started this campaign, I started it very strongly. It’s called “Make America Great Again.” We’re going to make America great. We have a depleted military. It has to be helped, has to be fixed. We have the greatest people on Earth in our military. We don’t take care of our veterans. We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally better than we take care of our vets. That can’t happen.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:31:34"
"Donald Trump","Our policemen and women are disrespected. We need law and order, but we need justice, too. Our inner cities are a disaster. You get shot walking to the store. They have no education. They have no jobs. I will do more for African-Americans and Latinos than she can ever do in 10 lifetimes. All she’s done is talk to the African-Americans and to the Latinos, but they get the vote, and then they come back, they say, “We’ll see you in four years.” We are going to make America strong again, and we are going to make America great again, and it has to start now. We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that’s what you get when you get her.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-3rd-presidential-debate-transcript-2016","Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton 3rd Presidential Debate Transcript 2016","01:32:01"
"Chris Wallace","Thank you both. Secretary Clinton … Hold on just a moment, folks. Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, I want to thank you both for participating in all three of these debates. That brings to an end this year’s debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. We want to thank the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and its students for having us. Now the decision is up to you. While millions have already voted, Election Day, November 8th, is just 20 days away. One thing everyone here can agree on: We hope you will go vote. It is one of the honors and obligations of living in this great country.
