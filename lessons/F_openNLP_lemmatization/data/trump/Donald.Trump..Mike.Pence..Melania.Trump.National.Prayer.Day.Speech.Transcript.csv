"Mike Pence","… Continue this great tradition. It’s such a timeless [inaudible 00:00:05], though it is not the first time our president has called on the nation during our present national crisis to pray. It was in March of this year, the president asked the American people to join, in his words, in a day of prayer for all people, all those affected by the coronavirus pandemic, and to pray for God’s healing hand to be placed on the people of our nation. And I can tell you that your first family and our family have been inspired every day to see the way that the American people have taken up that call, not just to pray, but to act in the midst of this national crisis.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-melania-trump-national-prayer-day-speech-transcript","Donald Trump, Mike Pence, Melania Trump National Prayer Day Speech Transcript","00:00"
"Mike Pence","We’ve seen people of every creed in this country, in every city and every state step forward to put feed on their faith with countless acts of kindness and generosity to those in need. The Bible says, “Because of the Lord’s great love, we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail.” And neither have the compassions or the generosity of the American people failed in this hour. So, on this national day of prayer, we count it a privilege to simply say to the American people, thank you for your prayers and thank you for all you have done to see your family, your friends, your neighbors, and even strangers through these unprecedented times. But today, with the deepest respect and a grateful heart, we urge you to be persistent in prayer. On this national day of prayer, pray for the families who’ve lost loved ones and pray for those who at this very hour are struggling with the severest consequences of the coronavirus.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-melania-trump-national-prayer-day-speech-transcript","Donald Trump, Mike Pence, Melania Trump National Prayer Day Speech Transcript","01:03"
"Mike Pence","Pray for our doctors and nurses and healthcare workers who have cared for our families as if they were their own, and have not just provided the health care that any one of us would want for a loved one, but in so many cases our doctors and nurses and healthcare workers and… Literally taken the place of family and loved ones for patients enduring the isolation of the coronavirus. Pray for the police, firefighters, and first responders, who without regard to their personal safety have rendered care and sped those impacted by this dread virus to healing hands. And as we gather today and remember these families and these heroes and all of those who have labored every day to protect our nation during these challenging times, let’s also remember to pray for all of the men and women who defend this nation in good times and bad. Who wear the uniform of the United States, who are standing opposed at this hour in far flung places around the world, who are deploying as we speak to defend this great nation. Let’s remember them as well.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-melania-trump-national-prayer-day-speech-transcript","Donald Trump, Mike Pence, Melania Trump National Prayer Day Speech Transcript","02:48"

That if his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray, let’s know that he’ll do like he’s always done throughout every challenging hour in the history of this nation. He’ll hear from heaven and he’ll heal this land.

Let us pray for the ill, the ones who are suffering and those serving on the front lines. When evil darkens our world, give us light. When despair numbs our souls, give us hope. When we stumble and fall, lift us up. When doubts assail us, give us faith. When nothing seems sure, give us trust. When ideals fade, give us vision.

It’s all over the world, but I want to thank you very much. Great job. You do your work so hard. On this national day of prayer, America is engaged in a fierce battle against a very terrible disease.

He wanted to make sure that they could put food on the table and he wanted to take care of their families. Even though he’s losing a lot of income, which he could always use. We can always use it.

Job 22:28 says, “If you decree a thing and declare a thing, it will be established.” So God, we come in agreement with your word and with your name, the name of Jesus. Psalm 40:17 says, “You are my help and my deliver. Do not delay, oh God.” I declare no more delays to the deliverance of COVID-19, no more delays to healing and a vaccination, no more delays to restoration of this great nation, the United States of America.

For Deuteronomy 28:8 says, “Command your blessing upon this land.” You said in Deuteronomy 8:9 to bring us into good land without any lack. For your word declares in Psalm 33:2, “Blessed is the nation whose God is Lord.” So I declare to you right now to be Lord over this nation, over the United States of America, and re-receive your blessing over any plague, over any economic distress.

We declare victory in the name of Jesus. Isaiah 58:11 says, “Guide him continually.” And you said in Psalm 78:72 that you would guide him by the stillfulness of your hand.

Like David, who had had victory, after victory, after victory, after victory, would face his biggest battle. It was called ziklag. And they would take his wives and his children, and the city would be burned down. And he cried and he wept. And he began to pray out to God and God gave him a word. And through fasting and praying, I believe this is the word for you and for this nation.

"Rabbi Ariel Sadwin","Thank you Mr. President. King Solomon in his great wisdom writes in the second chapter of Song of Songs, ” There he stands behind our wall, gazing through the windows, peering through the lattice. The Midrash commentary explains this to be referring to almighty God. At a time when his presence is not visible, nor it is readily apparent, but fear not says King Solomon, he is right there. In the background. Watching you through the window and the lattice. [Foreign language 00:36:57] Oh our merciful Father.” This idea is so apparent and reminiscent to this most challenging time during which we find ourselves. Our relationship with you seems so different from what it always has been. We have not been in your house, our holy Synagogues in nearly two months. These sacred places where we go to seek you and to derive inspiration three time a day, every day, are empty, dark, and shuttered. Instead, all we have had is the sanctuary of our own homes and the limited allowable interactions. There is fear, there is sickness, there is death, whenever we turn and whenever we listen. But yet we know you are still there, watching over us as always.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-melania-trump-national-prayer-day-speech-transcript","Donald Trump, Mike Pence, Melania Trump National Prayer Day Speech Transcript","36:18"
