They thought it was over. It’s a rough plague. I call it the plague. I call it the scourge. I call it whatever you want to call it. It’s rough. It’s bad. A woman that I’ve really found fascinating, she’s from a state that’s a great state and a city that’s been hit very hard. Really very, very hard. Detroit. Highly respected. She’s a political person. She doesn’t happen to be a Republican, and that’s okay. When things aren’t going good and you get a little help from a Republican, we’ll take that too.

I thought just saying thank you meant thank you and I do, I sincerely appreciate that. Because had you not brought this to the forefront of the HQ of being able to put this out here, I wouldn’t be here today to even have this conversation with you and to be able to talk about the needs of Detroit and talk about the people who really need this, and they need help.

That lasted about five, six days, and then I thought I was … I was telling people, “I’m fine. It was just kind of like a bad flu.

Couldn’t hit a major league curve ball. But he was a great football player. But he got hurt.

Essentially, I was driving with my family in Northern Michigan. I have three kids, Caden, Evan, and Case, and a wife, Michelle. Stop. The only thing I can think of that I did out of the ordinary, because none of them had, thank God, never had symptoms, still don’t have symptoms, I quarantined for them is I touched a gasoline pump handle. That’s literally the only thing that I can think of. I don’t exactly know how, to be completely frank with you, how I got it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meets-with-recovered-covid-19-patients","Transcript: Donald Trump Meets with Recovered COVID-19 Patients","27:28"
"Donald Trump","But that’s the only thing, because you must go back and torture yourself with-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meets-with-recovered-covid-19-patients","Transcript: Donald Trump Meets with Recovered COVID-19 Patients","28:05"
"Mark","Trying to figure it out. Lots of time. I mean, when it’s all said and done, I’ve had roughly 30 days of quarantine. That’s 30 days without being able to kiss your kids and wife and do those things that you normally do.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meets-with-recovered-covid-19-patients","Transcript: Donald Trump Meets with Recovered COVID-19 Patients","28:10"
"Donald Trump","Why so long [inaudible 00:00:28:21]?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meets-with-recovered-covid-19-patients","Transcript: Donald Trump Meets with Recovered COVID-19 Patients","28:20"
"Mark","Because right at basically a 12 days, I went into the hospital, I spent another five days in the hospital and when I got out of the hospital I asked the physician, “How long does the quarantine last?” And I think the safe and easy answer was 14 days. Now, I’ll tell you, I went to Creighton Hospital, Rochester, Michigan. They were fantastic. The physicians, especially the nurses, like God bless the nurses in everything they do. My sister Diane is one of them. They were fantastic. They were absolutely fantastic. And for a place where the one thing I think we’ve all kind of touched upon is, look, when you’re in the hospital, when you’re in that position, quite honestly, it’s lonely. I don’t know if that sounds weak or what, but you’re by yourself. Right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meets-with-recovered-covid-19-patients","Transcript: Donald Trump Meets with Recovered COVID-19 Patients","28:22"

"Mark","Not allowed. Not allowed. Right? And so when those nurses come in and see you and not allowed, not allowed, right. So when the nurses come in and check your vitals every three to four hours, it’s like, “All right, I’ve got somebody to talk to.” Right? So especially when you start to feel better.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meets-with-recovered-covid-19-patients","Transcript: Donald Trump Meets with Recovered COVID-19 Patients","29:12"
"Donald Trump","A very good guy. Right? Gregarious, I guess they call it. He wants people, he wants people. That’s good. Go ahead.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meets-with-recovered-covid-19-patients","Transcript: Donald Trump Meets with Recovered COVID-19 Patients","29:23"
"Mark","Yeah. So I went through that process … Well, technically, just so I back up, if I may just for a bit. So I got in, thought there’s no way. Okay. I should check my temperature. I don’t feel right, but I thought to myself, “There’s no way.” In fact, I made the joke to my wife Michelle that I think I’ve got coronavirus. I’m just totally kidding. I took, my temperature, it was like, 102.6 so I did like any guy, or at least my buddies would do, I said, “I’ll go watch a movie and see if it kind of backs off.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meets-with-recovered-covid-19-patients","Transcript: Donald Trump Meets with Recovered COVID-19 Patients","29:30"
"Mark","Well, it didn’t. So I went through the drive through for screening and basically I was sent home and said, well go quarantine for 14 days and see, you’ll get through this. Chances are you probably have it. So the athlete in me, I will tell you this, the athlete in me, that’s the tough guy that just pushes, right? Grinding and just getting things done. It kind of worked against me here because truthfully if I could have recognized, Hey, stop trying to beat this thing when it’s only getting worse, I probably would have went to the hospital sooner.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meets-with-recovered-covid-19-patients","Transcript: Donald Trump Meets with Recovered COVID-19 Patients","29:58"
"Mark","I do not … And I was very aware of not overwhelming hospitals, but my points here for bringing that up is I probably would have also got out of the hospital much quicker. So instead of a five day stay, possibly been a two or three day stays, specially if they would have prescribed HCQ, that would have been fantastic.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meets-with-recovered-covid-19-patients","Transcript: Donald Trump Meets with Recovered COVID-19 Patients","30:32"

"Donald Trump","Everybody always, every year the new ones come along and you just stayed there. Ten years is a long time in the NFL. That’s a great tribute to you as a fighter. I want to thank everybody. This has been incredible. I thought this would be a five minute meeting, but I found each one of your stories so interesting. And hopefully the media can play some of these stories because they’re just… we’re going through something the likes of which, I guess, we’ve never seen. Maybe you go back to 1917, 1918. That was the big plague. That was a big one. And anywhere from, Mike, I guess, 75 to 100 million people died. It started here. It started in a certain location. I don’t want to say because I love that location so I’m not going to say it. But it started in this country and actually got brought to Europe. And Europe is where it did its… thousands of people died here, large numbers. But, in Europe, tens of millions of people died. So, we gave them no favor when whoever it is went over to Europe. Right? No favor.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meets-with-recovered-covid-19-patients","Transcript: Donald Trump Meets with Recovered COVID-19 Patients","33:51"
"Donald Trump","But not since then have we seen anything like this. And we’re winning our battle. We’re winning our war. We’re going to be announcing some very good things in the near future. The American public has been great, far greater than anybody would have thought. They had minimum numbers of 100,000 and I think we’re going to beat that. 100,000 deaths, can you believe that? That was a minimum? And, if we didn’t practice what we practiced, and if we did it a different way, because we had a maximum of 2.2 million people, who knows even if that’s right. But the way I look at it, if you cut it in half and cut it in half again, it’s five or 600,000. That’s what we lost in the Civil War. That’s not acceptable.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meets-with-recovered-covid-19-patients","Transcript: Donald Trump Meets with Recovered COVID-19 Patients","34:54"

"Mike Pence","I just want thank all of these courageous Americans. Thank you for being willing to be here and share your story. It is a tribute to your resilience. It’s tribute to those healthcare workers, Mark, that you were talking about that we’re there for you. And just the president and I wanted to have a chance to see all of you and let the country hear your stories. Because, while we rightly as a nation, reflect on the more than 23,000 Americans who have succumbed to the Coronavirus, as a tribute to our healthcare workers, we also do well to reflect on more than 44,000 Americans who have fully recovered. And you’re among them.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meets-with-recovered-covid-19-patients","Transcript: Donald Trump Meets with Recovered COVID-19 Patients","35:59"

And I just want to promise you that this president and this vice president and our entire White House Coronavirus Task Force are going to continue to work every day and have more stories like yours across this nation, until we put the Coronavirus in the past and eventually someday have a vaccine that ends this once and for all.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meets-with-recovered-covid-19-patients","Transcript: Donald Trump Meets with Recovered COVID-19 Patients","36:42"
"Donald Trump","I think so. And I think we’re making a lot of progress on vaccines. We’re making a lot of progress on maybe a cure, meaning a pill. Because I think right now I’d like to have that more than the vaccine. The vaccine takes a little longer because they have to test it for a period of a year or more. And so, it’s something we’re going to come with. And I really think we’re making, therapeutically, we’re making tremendous, I think, tremendous progress, tremendous progress.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meets-with-recovered-covid-19-patients","Transcript: Donald Trump Meets with Recovered COVID-19 Patients","37:18"
"Donald Trump","And we’re going to see whether or not, Mark, whether or not what you did and whether or not what Karen did, whether or not that’s a big part of the answer. But I think it could be a part of the answer. Let’s see, as one alternative. But we’re going to have numerous alternatives. There’s another one just came, the Gilead drug, remdesivir, just came out.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meets-with-recovered-covid-19-patients","Transcript: Donald Trump Meets with Recovered COVID-19 Patients","37:46"

We’re going to announce the groups of people that are going to be talking to us. We’ve made a lot of progress today. You see what’s happening with our bump, our big bump in the road.

But we’ll be doing that in a little while, especially in terms of the people. We have a lot of great people in this country that know the different fields. And we have… a lot of skill is going to have to be used to get our country back to where it was. And we want to do it quickly, whether it’s restaurants, or whether it’s airplane business, or whether it’s a lot of other things. We have a lot of businesses. And we have the best people in every profession, including medical and including political. We have a political group too, a lot of great politicians.
