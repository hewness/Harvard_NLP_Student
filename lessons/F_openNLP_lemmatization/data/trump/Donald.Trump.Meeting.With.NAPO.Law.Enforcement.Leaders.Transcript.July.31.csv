"President Trump","Police representatives in the country here, maybe the best, I would say. Pat, what do you think? The best. Representing more than 240,000 of our nation’s courageous police officers. I want to thank the association president and a friend of mine, Mick McHale, who has been tremendous. Who I call on occasionally to say, what the hell is happening in a certain location and he gives me the advice and I was very honored to receive the endorsement. That was a great endorsement. We very much appreciate it Mick. The entire leadership team is here today, representing large portions. What would you say the percentage of police in the country are represented in this room? Big portion.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","00:11"
"Mick Mchale","Yes, sir.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","00:54"
"President Trump","Very big portion. I appreciate it. Also, I want to thank our Vice President, Mike Pence. He’s been very involved in a lot of issues, but this issue is one of his very important ones. I think we can say Mike, right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","00:55"
"VP. Mike Pence","Thank you Mr. President.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","01:05"
"President Trump","We’re here to discuss the unwavering support of our nation’s courageous police officers and our determination to defend the safety of all Americans. I just spoke on Portland. I just spoke with Chad Wolf who’s doing a fantastic job at Homeland and the courthouse is totally secure. It has been ever since we’ve been there. We had to move in about a week and a half ago because they were going to take down the federal court house. This is not even believable. You tell these stories, it’s not even believable. Homeland Security moved a team of very talented people, strong, tough people. And the courthouse has been in very good shape. They’re not an offensive team, they’re a defensive team. They’re not allowed to be offensive, unfortunately. And you had radical anarchists. You had horrible people. You had agitators.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","01:07"
"President Trump","There weren’t protesters, they might’ve been protesters, but the ones that were the problem were absolute anarchists and in many cases, professionals. So a lot of people have been arrested and we’ve told the mayor, we told the governor, you better get in there and do your thing. And they finally, after… they should have done the 60 days ago, a lot of people have been hurt and a lot of law enforcement people have been hurt and they should have done this 60 days ago. So now they freed up the park, cleaned out the park and they’re moving their way in. And if they have any other problems, we’re going to take a very strong, offensive force. Nothing started because the federal government was there. In fact, if we weren’t there, you would not have a courthouse right now. The media, some of the media, not all of it, but some of it, they are saying that because the federal government walked in, they became worse. No. Because the federal government walked in we saved the US courthouse, the federal courthouse, which was a magnificent, it will be shortly.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","01:58"
"President Trump","But there’s graffiti all over it and everything else. That’s why we moved in because the local police were not protecting federal property. So Homeland Security has done a fantastic job. I appreciate it. Chad Wolf and the entire team have been fantastic. And it seems to be cleaning up. And if it doesn’t clean up, we’re going to do something very, very powerful because we have no choice. Not that I want to do it. I don’t want to do it, but we have no choice. In recent weeks, law enforcement has become the target of a dangerous assault by the radical left. The left wing extremists have spread mayhem throughout the streets of different cities. In particular, Portland. If you look, Portland is one. Seattle, certainly would be another. And we were getting ready to go into Seattle. We would have solved that problem very quickly.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","02:57"
"President Trump","When they heard that we were going in, they went in and by that time, the anarchist were exhausted and they just raised their hand. They were exhausted and tired and they had a lot of drugs and a lot of alcohol and they just gave up. They just raised their hands. They were sleeping there long enough. They took over actually a piece of Seattle, if you can believe that. Seattle being a major city and they took over a piece. So we were ready to go into Seattle, everyone knows that. We were going to go in with force and we didn’t have to because the day before we were going in, and we let them know. The day before we were going in this is what happens. They went in and the anarchistic and agitators gave up and they gave it back. Joe Biden’s pledge to cut police funding, you do know about that, Mick.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","03:44"
"Mick Mchale","I do, sir.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","04:34"
"President Trump","You’ve heard [inaudible 00:04:36]. This guy has been dragged so far left. Biden has been taken further left than Bernie ever was. Bernie was never this. I mean, totally opened borders and the sanctuary city stuff that… he’s approving things that Bernie never thought of. It was supposed to be they were going to take them right. They took Biden way left of where Bernie was because they have the manifesto. I don’t know. Have you seen the manifest or they’ve got? Now I understand they can’t get any police in Milwaukee because you’re not allowed to use pepper spray or tear gas, because if you have cramps, but I don’t think there’s any other way, other than the obvious way, which would be horrible. And that’s shooting itself, which would be horrible. But I don’t know how you can control a crowd if the crowd is… if that crowd’s anything like what you have in Portland, there’s no way you could possibly do it without your tear gas and pepper spray. Pat, would you say that’s a correct statement?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","04:35"
"Pat","I agree. You have to control the streets. You have to do it fairly but you have to do it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","05:30"
"President Trump","That’s pretty amazing, right? So you have no police that want to go to Portland because they know they can’t do their job. You have to give them the equipment to do the job. That’s incredible. They’re not going to go to Milwaukee. So what’s going to happen in Milwaukee, Mick? What do you think?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","05:34"
"Mick Mchale","I think they’re going to have to [inaudible 00:05:49] country. And again, sir, it’s the exposure of these men and women who continue to suit up and provide the safety that they took an oath to. As an association, when we speak for all law enforcement and thanking you personally for your executive order which allowed us the surplus equipment. That equipment is saving our lives, literally, sir. And we thank you. We thank for all of us.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","05:48"
"President Trump","Thank you. That was very controversial. The previous administration didn’t want to do that. We had hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment, really good military equipment, good stuff. And a lot of it was protective, was defensive equipment like vehicles that are very strong in terms of defense capability, where you wouldn’t get hurt, where the windows are shatterproof, et cetera, and bulletproof. And we gave that out to our police departments. It was sitting there gaining dust. That was the only thing that it was gaining, was dust. And we gave that out to all of our police departments all over the country. And you have no idea. Every time I go someplace, the police thank me for that. This is stuff that was just getting less and less valuable. Much of it was brand new, but getting less and less valuable, sitting in warehouses, probably the government was paying a lot of rent to the warehouses.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","06:20"
"President Trump","And it’s been a great thing. So as a result of the outrageous attacks on law enforcement, violent crime has surged in certain Democrat run cities. Many of them, I mean, you look at New York, it’s at 348%. Whoever heard of a number like that? Because you have a radical left mayor who doesn’t know what he’s doing. He doesn’t know what he’s doing. I don’t understand even how the police can allow it to happen. That’s the only thing. We talk about that. But you look at Chicago and Chicago more than 2,200 people have been shot. Think of that, shot. Now, that’s far worse than Afghanistan. We are leaving Afghanistan fairly shortly, but we see things in Chicago and other places that you don’t see in Afghanistan, it’s unbelievable. 40% increase from 2019. And the hard thing is that crime is down nationwide.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","07:15"
"President Trump","So I’m taking all of these Democrat run cities and we’re putting them in with the well-run cities and Republican, largely Republican, well run cities and States. And with all of the shooting that you see in Chicago and New York, and well, Minneapolis had a bad period, but we sent in the National Guard. The National Guard did a fantastic job. And they stopped it. That place would have burned down. Minneapolis would have burned down if I didn’t force the National Guard into that. And you saw them form, right? It’s a beautiful thing. All of a sudden, you see a line of people. They walked through it like a knife through butter and that was the end of the problem in Minneapolis. So we have to do that. But in New York city, nearly 300 people have been shot in the last month alone. Murders are up 32% in Philadelphia and 80% in Minneapolis compared to last year. Minneapolis, great place too, and Philadelphia, you think of it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","08:13"
"President Trump","I went to school in Philadelphia. You look at these numbers. In cities across the nation. We’ve also seen police officers assaulted with bricks, rocks, bats, Molotov cocktails, frozen bottles of water. Somebody said last night, what are these protesters I saw it and he said, “It’s only water. How can water hurt you?” They don’t say it’s frozen in a bottle the size of a football and they throw it at the police. It’s unbelievable. It’s water. And then they have cans of soup. Soup, and they throw the cans of soup. That’s better than a brick because you can’t throw a brick, it’s too heavy. But a can of soup you can really put some power into that, right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","09:07"
"Mick Mchale","Yes sir.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","09:51"
"President Trump","And then when they get caught, they say, “No, this is soup for my family” And they’re so innocent. This is soup from my family. It’s incredible. And you have people coming over with bags of soup, big bags of soup. And they lay it on the ground and the anarchists take it and they start throwing it at our cops, at our police. And if it hits you, that’s worse than a brick because it’s got force. It’s the perfect size. It’s made perfect. And when they get caught, they say, “No, this is just soup for my family.” And then the media says, “This is just soup. These people are very, very innocent. They’re innocent people. These are just protestors. Isn’t it wonderful to allow protesting?” No. And by the way, the media knows it better than we do. They know what’s going on. I don’t know what’s wrong with them. They’re doing our country a tremendous disservice, I’ll say that. But in cities all across our nation, we’ve seen our police officers so badly assaulted.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","09:51"
"President Trump","In Portland and the other cities, my administration is vigorously defending federal property from anarchists and criminals. We’ve also launched Operation Legend, surging federal law enforcement to communities flagged by violent crime. And we’re willing to help Chicago. We’re willing to help New York. We’re willing to help Philadelphia, any city you want. But by law, unless we go a special route, which we have the right to do, but it’s very rarely done. We have to be asked by the local government, by the mayors and by the governors. And they don’t want to do it, I think for two reasons. Number one, they’re embarrassed to do it. And number two, I actually think they’re afraid of these people. If you want to know the truth. I actually think these are radical left maniacs. And I actually think, Pat, I think they’re afraid of these people. I think they’re afraid of those people that I see in Portland and to a lesser extent that I’ve seen in Seattle. The Portland is a tougher group.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","10:48"
"President Trump","They’ve been doing that for years to Portland. They’ve been doing it for years and years to Portland and the police stepped down and I don’t believe it’s the police’s fault. They’re not allowed to do it. They’re good police and they can do it. Let’s see how they do tonight. Last night, it was a big step, but let’s see how they do. So it’s an honor to have the associations here. We have been with them. I’ve had endorsements from so many police. And I don’t even say thank you anymore, I say what’s your choice? Your choice is me or somebody that has no clue what they’re doing. And I say that kiddingly, but I sort of mean it, right? I sort of mean it. So our relationship with law enforcement has been outstanding. And with firefighters.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","11:50"
"President Trump","I mean, you have firefighters that go to put out a fire and people are shooting at them. They’re literally shooting at them as they’re putting out the fire. Guys are going up on ladders and people shoot at them. We have great support from firefighters. Usually just the top one or two people don’t support us because they’re used to something else. But everybody in there, we have tremendous support from the police, the firefighters and almost-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","12:37"
"President Trump","… support from the police, the firefighters, and almost every group of people that are associated with the things that we’re doing and doing really well. But I want to thank you all very much from the bottom of my heart. I appreciate those endorsements. We really do. It’s really great. And you will never be let down with me. I have tremendous respect for what you do. It’s dangerous. It pays not as well as they could do elsewhere. Many of the people, but they’re discouraged, many of the people, they do it, they love it, right? They love it. Nothing they’d rather do. This is what they want to do. But it’s a very dangerous profession. And we are going to toughen it up a lot because the mayors and the governors aren’t allowing you to do your job, and you got to be allowed to do your job. When you see the things that we’ve seen in St. Louis…","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","13:03"
"President Trump","By the way, you look at the last administration with Ferguson and all of the problems they’ve had, I mean, they had some problems that are doozies. People said, “Oh, the last administration…” That’s what started a lot of this. If you look at some of the things that they had, I could name 10 of them right now. But we have to strengthen up because you’re being told to do things that you know can’t happen. In Seattle they’re reducing the force by massive numbers. In Portland they’re reducing their force. Can you imagine that? In Portland they’re reducing that force by massive numbers. But then the governor, like in Oregon, the governor said things that are just unbelievable. She doesn’t want it to get better. The mayor of Seattle, the things that she said. We’re going to have a summer of love. There’s something going on that is crazy.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","13:52"
"President Trump","Remember this though. Most of our cities are doing really, really well. And despite the pandemic… And we’re doing a good job on that. We have vaccines that are really getting close. We have therapeutics that are really getting close, but despite all of that, these cities are doing very well, and law enforcement’s at an all time good. So most of it’s good. We only talk about the bad. But most of it’s good. Pat, would you like to say something in representing New York’s finest? And we’ll go around the room a little bit.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","14:46"
"Pat","We sure do. In our city we’re going through a difficult time. We have a progressive mayor that’s anti-police, a city council that’s anti-police, and the state house is anti-police. So they’re changing the law where it’s becoming impossible to do our job. And remember what our job is, to keep folks safe. You do that by helping the good people going after the bad people. They’re stopping us from doing that. So we come down here-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","15:20"
"President Trump","So the mayor tells you you can’t do that. Your job is to keep people safe, right? So is that a higher calling than listening to a mayor?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","15:40"
"Pat","Well, you know what? They’re the boss in our town, so we have to go by the rules they set. The problem is the rules they are setting, the laws they’re passing are making it impossible because what happens then, we are criminally charged. So we come here today, Mr. President, to ask for help, to have a discussion-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","15:50"
"President Trump","Do they actually charge you criminally?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","16:04"
"Pat","Yeah, can charge us criminally. Yes, sir. It’s disgraceful. It’s like they reversed the world. It’s the upside down world right now. And I have 36 years in the job. I’ve never seen it this bad, sir.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","16:06"
"President Trump","Never been an event like it. Hey, look, I lived in New York and we never had a problem in New York. New York is… Once Rudy… Rudy did a great job as mayor, in all fairness, because before that… But I think this is worse than the Dinkins era now. How do you compare this to the Dinkins era?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","16:15"
"Pat","It’s worse. We had disturbances back during Mayor Dinkins’ time, but we had it in one neighborhood, possibly two. We had disturbances recently in three boroughs, sir. We have neighborhoods where your father started that it’s going back to be crime-ridden, into Manhattan where you did so much building. It’s starting to go back to crime. They looted in Midtown, so obviously there’s a problem.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","16:29"
"President Trump","And with Dinkins, if you go back to that period, everybody respected the police and the police were allowed to do their job, in all… It was never like we’re going to cut our police force. It was always we’re going to get more police, in all fairness. And then Rudy came in and did a great job. So it’s one of those things. I think you have to do what you have to do. I mean, you have to keep people safe. You have to keep people safe.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","16:49"

"Speaker 2","We represent almost 33,000 law enforcement officers in the state of New Jersey. And I was talking this morning with these guys and I said that the defund the police has already… the experiment has already proven how poorly it is throughout the country. In New Jersey they’re talking about the new use of force policy with proportional force. And my response is if you want to see a fair fight, go to a wrestling match where 185 fights 185. We want to end these resistant cases as quickly as possible. There’s nothing pretty about somebody resisting arrest. And if you’re going to use proportional force, you-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","19:17"
"President Trump","So what does that mean? That means you can’t put two on one? You can’t put three on one? What does that all mean? You mean you have to give the criminal a chance? Is that what they’re saying?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","19:56"

"Speaker 2","But nationwide, it’s proportional. It’s a use of force continuum. You can always extend. You can always go up in one level, and in New Jersey the discussion now is the proportional use of force which, to me, is going to make us look worse on the street.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","20:16"
"President Trump","You know, what people don’t understand is that the people, the voters, are with you guys 100%. I’ll bet you if you looked it would be really… I don’t want to say a number because then they’ll say, “Oh, he was wrong in the number. The number is two points lower.” It’s a tremendous number. The people of our country love you guys. The people of our country want protection. They want safety. And what they’re doing is they’re just stripping… This radical left movement is stripping you of everything. And we’re not going to let that happen.

"President Trump","Okay. Here’s a question for you. So you work for all. What do you think is the worst? Where are they treated the worst, the police? Where are they treated the worst? And where is the biggest onus of problem? In other words, who here at this table, and this is just a small group of what we have, what area’s treated the worst? Is it New York? Is it Massachusetts? You just said something. Although what I heard from New Jersey, I’m shocked because I know those great troopers on the highway.

"President Trump","But for speeding. I haven’t gotten one of them recently. But I’d get pulled over, and I’d look at those guys, I’d say, “That guy, I’m not going to mess with that guy.” But what area is treated the worst, meaning they’ve taken their power away?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","21:49"
"Speaker 3","I don’t think there’s just one area. We hear from our membership across the country about various attempts to handcuff cops and their ability to do their job. I just think it depends on the area and what policies people are trying to push. I think cops across the country are having a very difficult time doing their job with very little public support.

"President Trump","Well, you had really public support, but it’s sort of that silent majority that we talked… But it’s not a silent majority. It’s a massive majority. It’s not anything about… The word majority is not a good enough word. You have tremendous public support. And these people feel they have to do this, the politicians, in order to stay relevant in this far left movement. John, what would you say about that? What would you say is treated the worst in terms of areas?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","22:24"

"Pat","It’s getting worse by the day. Each morning you wake up, first you get a text on the number of shootings and deaths you had the night before. Sir, you remember when you were building in Manhattan and crime was out of control. We’re back to 1993 numbers. Who thought we’d be back there? In South Jamaica the numbers have gone crazy. When we turn the city around now, it’s starting to slide back.

"Pat","This is hard. And what folks in our city hall forget that we’re police officers, we have a shield on our chest, but we’re also citizens. We’re also in the church, synagogue, or mosque. We’re also at the same street corner dropping our children’s off, going to the same schools. We’re in the same shopping malls, the same grocery stores. So we’re part of the community, and they’re trying to cut us out.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","23:32"
"President Trump","Pat, I remember two years ago, three years ago, when the police didn’t respect the mayor. That never changed, in all fairness, but they would literally turn their back on their mayor, and he was really working hard to get them on his side. And now it’s almost as though it’s just the opposite. And why is that?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","23:52"
"Pat","You know what? It takes more than words. You can read from a script. It’s your actions. You can say you support police, but then pass laws that hurt us so we know it’s not true. If you remember when we turned our back on the mayor at the time, we had just had two police officers assassinated. What folks don’t understand is we went to city hall and begged that they stop the rhetoric. We said, “Someone’s going to get hurt.” You know what happened? It was worse. They got killed. Ramos and Liu were assassinated in our favorite borough, Brooklyn. So it was a serious time, but it’s gotten more serious since then, sir.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","24:09"

"Pat","Yeah. So the communities have to realize that it’s not just rhetoric. It’s really their blood on the streets it’s happening in. As I said, the numbers are going back to 1990s and shooting.

"Mike Pence","Association. You have a President and a Vice President and administration who understand. Men and women who serve in law enforcement have no ordinary jobs. You put on a uniform, you kiss your family goodbye in the morning, and you count our lives more important than your own. So please let them know that all of the passion that they hear from the President and this administration, the support that you have among the American people, which I believe, with the President, is the overwhelming majority of the American people, comes from a deep gratitude. Secondly, thank you for the endorsement of the National Association of Police Organizations.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","39:03"

And I know that police officers across the country have supported this president each and every day because they know that he understands the job that you do and support your work. But I can tell you firsthand, serving alongside him every day, that when we see Joe Biden and the Democratic party driven by radical Democrats to call for defunding the police, abolishing the police, dismantling local officials, dismantling, voting to dismantle local law enforcement agencies. We have leading politicians that have referred to police officers as storm troopers and use the most pejorative terms. I want to say to you that it has only steeled this president and this administration’s resolved to back to blue. And we are not going to defund the police. We’re going to support law enforcement every day.

I can tell you that everything you have heard from him four years ago, when he was first running for president, his devotion of men and women in law enforcement has only been steeled by the rise of the radical left and the attacks on law enforcement. And we are going to be with you every step of the way.

And you’re talking about peanuts by comparison to what they do and the damage they do and the lives that they destroy. You’re talking about a very small amount of money. So we’re with you all the way, 1000%. And I want to thank you all for being here. I really appreciate your support, [inaudible 00:41:49]. I support you. I mean, just by nature. It’s natural. It’s common sense. And you know what? If I thought you were doing a bad job, I’d let you know. You know that. You know that. I’d let know. And you’re not allowed to do your job, that’s the problem. You’re not allowed. And you’re dying to do your job.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","41:28"
"President Trump","You could’ve stopped that New York stuff the first night. In 10 minutes, you could have stopped it. And you would have saved a lot of lives and a lot of anger and a lot of hardship. And a lot of COVID, by the way. You would have stopped because I saw them marching on top of each other. You would have saved a lot. And you wanted to do it and they wouldn’t let you do it. I saw that. They wouldn’t let you do it. They were going, actually, the opposite way, turn your back. And then people start getting hurt that had nothing to do with it, they were getting hurt. They just don’t let you do your job. All right. Well, I want to thank-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","42:04"
"Speaker 11","Mr. President. On the negotiations with Congress, I think the Democrats are hoping to hear directly from you on what you support. Would you be willing to-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","42:40"
"President Trump","I think the Democrats don’t care about the people of our country. I really don’t. I tell my people, the Democrats do not care about the people of our country. They don’t want to do what you should be doing for the people of our country, whether it’s unemployment or anything else. And all they care about is the election. And they’re going to lose the election. You see what’s going on with the polls right now. I guess we just got one over 50%. Rasmussen just came out. You see what’s going on because the people get it. The Democrats are playing for November 3rd and we’re playing for the good of the people. It is a disgrace that they’re not negotiating, but they’re only looking to play a political game. I happen to think it’s a bad political game, I think it hurts them.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","42:47"

"President Trump","They know what I want. And what I want is I want our people to be able to live and live well because it wasn’t their fault that China brought in this pandemic, that China brought in this plague. It’s China’s fault. You want another truth? China should be paying for it. And maybe they will. Maybe they will. You’ll watch. You’ll watch.

"Peter","Mr. President, if we could ask you specifically, we heard yesterday your frustrations about how long it’ll take to count the ballots here. Then why aren’t we spending more energy to get the resources and the funding for the states that they want to be able to secure this election for all Americans?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","44:00"

"President Trump","So NBC, I just told you about the false report that NBC put out the other night about the mayor of Portland. And this is the kind of stuff you get. You’ll see what happens. And it’s common sense. Everyone knows mail in ballots are a disaster. You just have to take a look at the last recent … Take a look at New York City. Look at New York, they’re still counting your ballots, Pat. Do you know that? They had a race, a small race by comparison. By comparison, tiny. It’s so messed up they have no idea. There are ballots missing, thousands and thousands of ballots are missing. They they’re going to send hundreds of millions of ballots all over the United States and it’s going to come out. You won’t know the election result for weeks, months, maybe years after. Maybe you’ll never know the election result. And that’s what I’m concerned with. It’ll be fixed. It’ll be rigged. People ought to get smart.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","44:23"
"President Trump","And I just hope our Republican voters, the people that are for you, are going to do what they have to do. Absentee ballots are great because absentee ballots, you have to go through a process to get them. And it’s actually a great thing. Absentee ballots, I’m going to be voting absentee. An absentee ballot is one thing. A universal mail in ballot is a disaster. These governors are going to send out millions of ballots. They don’t even know where they’re sending them. I already have friends that got ballots for a son who died seven years ago. Oh, you don’t even want to talk about it. But the media knows this. Actually, the Washington Post wrote a great article. Of all groups, a week ago, the Washington Post wrote a great article that this is a disaster. This is going to be the greatest election disaster in history. And by the way, you guys like to talk about Russia and China and other places, they’ll be able to forge ballots, they’ll forge them. They’ll do whatever they have to do. People should go and they should vote or do an absentee ballot.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","45:13"

"President Trump","You didn’t understand me. I said absentee ballots are actually a very good thing. Absentee ballots are secure and they’re very good, but universal mail in are a disaster. You’re going to see at election that, and we’re going to do very well in the election. Nobody wants that date more than me. I wish we’d move it up. Okay. Move it up. But you’re not prepared for what they’re doing. And they’re using COVID. They’re using the China virus. China must be very happy about it because they hit us with a virus and now they screw up an election like you will never see. You watch what happens. I don’t think you’ll ever give me any statement, “I guess Trump was right.” But the people know I’m right. Watch what happens. New York City has a little election. We just talk, they’re never going to have the result of that election. Never the correct result. They’ll probably announce something at some point. But when did that take place? Like five, six weeks ago.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","46:21"
"President Trump","Absentee ballots, great. Going to the polls, great. If you do universal mail ins with millions and millions of ballots, you’re never going to know what the real result of an election is. It’s going to be a very, very sad day for our country. Go ahead.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-law-enforcement-leaders-transcript-july-31","Donald Trump Meeting With NAPO Law Enforcement Leaders Transcript July 31","47:18"

"President Trump","Oh, we’re doing, we’re putting in all the resources you can. But as a couple of the radical left people said, who actually agree with me, they said, “No matter what you do, we’re not prepared for this.” They’re not prepared for an onslaught of millions of ballots pouring in. They’re not prepared. They’re not prepared. You watch. They’re not going to announce anything on November 3rd. They’re not going to announce it on the fourth or the fifth of the sixth. It’ll go on forever. People should go. They voted during World War I, they voted during World War II. They went to the polls, they voted. They went to their booth and they voted proudly. But now with COVID, they don’t want to vote. It’s not they don’t want to vote. This will be catastrophic for our nation. And you’ll see it. I’m always right about things like this. I guess I must be. Or I wouldn’t be sitting here. Yes, Jennifer, go ahead. You want something?
