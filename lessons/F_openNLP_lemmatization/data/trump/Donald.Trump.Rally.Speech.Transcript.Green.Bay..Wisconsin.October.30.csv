"President Donald Trump","Wow. Thank you. What a crowd. What a beautiful crowd. Look at that, you can’t even see the end of it. What a great crowd. Thank you very much. Hello, Wisconsin. We’re back. We’re back. We’re going to win. We’re going to win this state. We win this state, you know what? It’s over, if we win Wisconsin. I’ve treated Wisconsin very well. Four days from now, we’re going to win this state and we’re going to win four more beautiful years in the White House. With your support, we will continue to bring back your jobs, cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our great police, defend our borders. Without borders, we don’t have a country, do we?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-green-bay-wisconsin-october-30","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Green Bay, Wisconsin October 30","01:56"
"President Donald Trump","Protect our second amendment, protect religious liberty and ensure more products are proudly stamped with those beautiful words, “Made in the USA.” They’re starting to do that. You remember, I used to say four years ago, “We’re going to bring back the words Merry Christmas.” We did, right? Merry Christmas. Those big department stores, they liked happy New Year. I said, “No, you can say them both, but you can’t do one without the other.” Merry Christmas is back. You notice that right? And pretty soon we’re going to be there. Joe Biden will shut down your state’s economy, wipe out your factories, ship your jobs to China.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-green-bay-wisconsin-october-30","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Green Bay, Wisconsin October 30","02:46"

"President Donald Trump","To China, that’s paid him off by the way. China that’s paid him off. You know that, right? Although you don’t get too much news, but you get enough, you know what’s going on. They don’t like giving you the news. Punish your family with a $4 trillion tax hike, eliminate private healthcare. 180 million people have private health care, they want to take it away. And send your state into a catastrophic… Do you want to use the word recession or depression? Because the word is depression. Biden has vowed to eliminate the entire US oil industry, no fracking, no energy and gas prices going five, six, $7 for a gallon. How do you like $2 gasoline, good? There’ll be no heating in the winter, no air conditioning in the summer and no electricity whenever the hell you want it. Right now, you have it made. You’re so lucky. You are so lucky I’m your president. And your team is doing a good job, right? They’re doing a good job, right? They are doing a good job. And while I’m president, America will proudly remain energy independent. How does that sound? First time, you’re energy independent. We’re the biggest in the world, nobody close. Biden will deliver poverty, misery, depression. I will deliver jobs, jobs, jobs, and the greatest economy in the history of our country. That’s going to be next year, you see it. Yesterday it was announced, last quarter, our economy grew at the astonishing speed, 33.1%. The largest GDP growth ever recorded. And not just by a little bit, by more than double. Right? And that was in 1952, but more than double. Think of it. It’s never been anything like that, for any country. Not only ours, for any country. In the past five months, we’ve created a record 11.4 million American jobs. We have a super V. I used to talk about the V. This is no longer V, this is a super V. This is despite the fact that the Democrat governors have States shut down, right? Gee, does that sound-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-green-bay-wisconsin-october-30","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Green Bay, Wisconsin October 30","03:31"

"President Donald Trump","Hey, does that sound familiar to you? Middle-class family income is up more than $6,000 under my administration, far greater than the past administration. I mean, that was not up. That was doing very poorly. We created the greatest economy in history, and now we’re doing it again. Make America Great Again, again. We did it once. That hat, see that hat is now obsolete. It’s called Make America Great Again, again. In a very recent poll Gallup, they said 56% of Americans said they were doing better today than they were four years ago. And we’re rounding the turn on a pandemic and it’s 56. And it’s the highest number they’ve ever recorded, so we’re doing something right.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-green-bay-wisconsin-october-30","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Green Bay, Wisconsin October 30","05:57"
"President Donald Trump","Joe Biden has spent the last 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars, in countries that most of you have never even heard of. I mean, think of it. And you know, at the debate… Did anybody see the debate by any chance? During the debate, he’d say, “Well, we’re going to do this.” I said, “Joe, why didn’t you do it?” “We’re going to do that. We’re going to do this to that, this and that.” “Joe, why didn’t you do it, Joe?” That was an easy debate. 91% to 9%, they said. That was good. That’s like a great football game. No, I said, “But Joe…” I said, “Joe, why didn’t you do it?” “Well, I don’t know exactly.” And then the last question was a disaster. Basically, he said, no more oil, no more fracking, no more anything. I said, “Did he say that?”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-green-bay-wisconsin-october-30","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Green Bay, Wisconsin October 30","06:50"
"President Donald Trump","And I just said, “We just left a great place…” You know that. It was a little cold there. This is like warm by comparison. This is a pleasure. This is a pleasure. That was cold. I said, “Let’s cut this a little bit shorter,” but we have a big crowd. We had a big crowd. No matter where we go, we have these massive crowds And I’m going up to Minnesota. We’re going to Minnesota, which we have a chance. Not since 1972, think of it. So those are odds that aren’t good, but they like us up there, with the Iron Range, all the things I’ve done for them up there. And helping them when the rioters and anarchist attacked. We took over and we did a great job. But they should have called us two weeks earlier, in all fairness, and they called. If they called us, federal government, if they called us two weeks earlier, that would have been nice. You would have had no problem. It took us about what? 25 minutes to solve the problem, right? Boom, they just marched.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-green-bay-wisconsin-october-30","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Green Bay, Wisconsin October 30","07:48"
"President Donald Trump","But we’re going and governor just informed us though, that… So we have 25,000 people, 25,000 people, that’s lot. You got a lot here. 25,000 people in Minnesota. They said we can only have 250 people. So they were hoping I’d say, “Oh, well, we can’t do that. Let’s turn around.” No, we’re going to go. We’re going to go. It’ll be a very interesting trip. Even if we see 250 people… Can I be honest with you? Everybody understands, you can’t play those games. That could very well, aside from Omar… Omar’s our secret weapon. Ilhan Omar, that’s our secret weapon in Minnesota. No, she doesn’t love our country. I don’t like people that don’t love our country, I don’t. And the other, and you know all about this because you’ve had your things, the other is we want law and order. We’ve got to have law and order. You look at what’s going on in Philadelphia, we can’t have that. You have to let the police do what they do. I mean, they have to do their job.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-green-bay-wisconsin-october-30","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Green Bay, Wisconsin October 30","08:47"
"President Donald Trump","When I watched that, again Democrats, it’s all Democrats, when I watched that and people are looting stores and you have the anarchists, the rioters, but they’re looting stores. They’re walking out with dishwashers. They’re walking out, guy has a dishwasher, he couldn’t even… He’s pushing it. Their washer… I mean, they have television sets and they’re walking and the police are standing there. And those police don’t want to be standing there. They don’t want to do that. They want to be able to do their job, but they’re not. And you can’t have that. We need law and order, as we had right here, as we did a very good job right here. We got the endorsement of everybody. Everybody in your state, every law enforcement group in your state endorsed us. I think every law enforcement group in the country endorsed us.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-green-bay-wisconsin-october-30","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Green Bay, Wisconsin October 30","09:56"
"President Donald Trump","I asked sleepy Joe, during one of the debates, I said, “Joe, who endorsed you from law enforcement?” And he couldn’t answer the question. Now possibly that happened, but he’s got a very bad memory too. He can’t… He was going, “Now, let me think. Give me about 20 minutes, I’ll figure it out.” I doubt he has any. I doubt he has any. I think we have everybody. We have everybody, Florida, Texas, Oklahoma. Chicago endorsed us. Isn’t that nice? Chicago, with all the problems they have. And they have a great group of people from law enforcement. They could stop those problems. I mean, you see what’s going on there. New York has gone through the roof, New York’s finest. We have New York’s finest, these are incredible police. They could do the job, but they have to be allowed to do the job. And they endorsed me. First time in the history of the police force in New York, that they endorsed a presidential candidate, so it was pretty cool.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-green-bay-wisconsin-october-30","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Green Bay, Wisconsin October 30","10:46"
"President Donald Trump","So Joe Biden tried to cut Medicare, during the course of his terms and he worked very hard on cutting social. You wouldn’t believe that, right? And we actually put it up. We put it on… Where is that screen? For places that we really like, we use the screen. It’s very expensive. You’ll see. Biden was a cheerleader for NAFTA, which is the worst trade deal ever made and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. Which of course Wisconsin, 130 minimum manufacturing jobs. At every turn, Biden betrayed American workers and twisted his knife into the back of Wisconsin workers. You suffered as much as anybody. Biden’s also spent half a century, really a half a century, betraying Black Americans. He devastated Black families with the 1994 Crime Bill. And he called Black youth, “Super predators,” a term that’s a terrible term. Super predators over and over again. And then he wonders why they’re not doing well with the Black vote. The Black votes not turning out for him.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-green-bay-wisconsin-october-30","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Green Bay, Wisconsin October 30","11:46"
"President Donald Trump","See, now we don’t have to go by the fake polls. Now you see what’s happening. He’s not doing well with the Black vote. You know why? Because they remember that, and they remember 1994 and they remember him calling everybody a super predator. And that’s a term that they don’t like. That’s a term that nobody would like. But they’re not showing up to vote, and others aren’t either. We’re doing great in Florida. We’re doing great in Ohio. We’re doing great in… North Carolina was fantastic. I think we’re doing really good in Pennsylvania. We’re doing very good in Pennsylvania. I think we’re doing good all over the place, you want to know the truth. I think we’re doing good all over. We’re doing great here. I think they just said here we’re either tied or one up or tied or one down.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-green-bay-wisconsin-october-30","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Green Bay, Wisconsin October 30","12:55"
"President Donald Trump","It’s like essentially tied. I don’t know how the hell I can be tied with this guy. He’s shot. He’s shot. They said, “Sir, you’re tied in Wisconsin.” Normally that means because we have like a hidden voter, people that don’t want to talk about it, they just go out and vote for Trump. I never knew. Should I be complimented by that? “We don’t want to talk about it. Leave us alone. We’re voting for Trump.” Right? So when you tied, that’s a good thing. But they said, “Sir, we’re tied.” And I said, “That’s interesting.” And then the fake Washington post, ABC, right?

"President Donald Trump","So, we are tied. I was up here two days ago. We gave a great speech. That was a cold one. We gave a speech on a racetrack. We got a lot of people and it was freezing, but I got through that. There was no way that I leave early or the great people of Wisconsin, because you don’t know about that. There was no way. Anyway, this pole, so we’re tied. Let’s say we’re tied, one up, one down, we’re right, boom. Very close, I think we’re going to take it, easily actually. I think we’re going to take it… Because we’re going to have a turnout, probably on Tuesday. Our people like to vote, they like to vote on Tuesday, not even on Sunday or Monday, but [inaudible 00:14:56]. So Washington Post and ABC, it’s called Washington Post-ABC Poll, they come out 17 down. “Donald Trump is 17 down in Wisconsin.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-green-bay-wisconsin-october-30","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Green Bay, Wisconsin October 30","14:18"

That was not a second place crowd. And they did it to me four years ago with crooked Hillary. They had me, “He’s down 12,” two weeks to go. You remember? Washington Post-ABC, crooked as hell. It’s called suppression polls. You know what it does? It suppresses the vote. You get depressed. You like Trump. You know, “I like the president, but let’s…” And in the case four years ago, “I like Donald Trump.

So when it came out 12 down, we actually wrote them legal letters and everything and then they changed the vote. Can you believe it? They change it, where we were one down, but that was the day before the election. Two weeks to go, 12 down. But this one was 17 down in your state and I said, “I could be three down. I could also be three up.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-green-bay-wisconsin-october-30","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Green Bay, Wisconsin October 30","15:46"

It was like a love fest. And then I wake up…” True. “And then I wake up like two days later and I see a poll, Washington Post, it’s all over the place…” They love it, all the fake news.

He’s fantastic, but we’ll get to him later. Your senator is fantastic. So you take a look and I said, “I’m not 17 now.” And he’s a really smart guy, he says, “No, you’re not.” I said, “But don’t they have to pay a price, like they did it 12 down, four years ago.” And then I said, “Isn’t it a bad thing?” He said, “Yeah, but they want you to lose.” I said, “Well, why don’t they make it that I’m three or two down, or make it believable?” “No, no. Three down or two down’s no good. Because if they go three down, two down, four, even five…” I said, “Make it five.” He said, “No, no good.

I knew it. I had a meeting with Ron Johnson and we were going to have a very complex tax. Most people had no idea what we were even talking about. He understood it so good.

And I mentioned that to Biden during one of the debates, I said, “Hey, Joe, say the words law and order, can you do it?” He wouldn’t do it because he didn’t want to lose the radical left. He didn’t want to lose them. Joe Biden and his party have spent the entire year inciting violence and hatred against our police officers. He refuses to say, you got to stop it.

I said, “You got to go in.” They took over a part of the city. I mean, this is even … to even talk about this, who would think of this? Seattle. And we were going in and we told them, “We’re coming in the morning,” and you know what they did? That evening they raised their hand and they left. That was the end of it.

It’s an old law. It’s amazing how we haven’t seen too much trouble with statutes. There were groups that formed. They wanted to do it. They wanted, and then they said, “Let’s get the hell out of here.” 10 years, 10 years. It says 10 years in prison, old law that we reenacted.

They’d say, “No, you’re allowed to rip down anything you want.” We have a DC mayor that set up a commission, to talk about all of the things, cancel culture let’s talk about. They don’t like the Washington monument. They want it renamed or taken down. This was their recommendation. But don’t worry about it. We’re not doing, I promise you.

When the violent mob came to a place known as Kenosha, did you ever hear of Kenosha? Because I did. Remember what I did? If I didn’t activate immediately, Kenosha would not be there any longer. They were going to take it down. Biden opposed sending in the National Guard and I insisted on it. And I frankly wish the Governor asked me sooner, but at least he asked me, but we came in and that was over at about another 15 minutes, right? That didn’t take long. That didn’t take long.

It was a photography store, was 100 years. They burned down the store, but it’s going to get rebuilt. But we stopped it. That whole area would have been burned to the ground. So we came in and it was so easy too. It’s easy, but you sometimes have to meet force with force. You can’t just stand back, sit back and watch it take place like they did in Minneapolis.

But I mean, we’re having these outdoor rallies. They say outdoor. Outdoor, normally would go into an arena. I actually like this stuff better. Although sometimes it’s snowing and sleet. I loved that last stop, but it was, the rain was pouring like sideways. It was going, “Sss,” that stuff. That’s when you say, I love the indoor arenas, but I like these. With a day like this it’s so beautiful. It’s great. Is there any place better to be that a Trump rally? No, seriously.

You see what’s happening in Europe? They’re trying it again. They’re going to close up. They closed up and they destroyed their economy. Our economy is so much better, so much stronger. Went down so much less. And now it’s come up faster than any country in the world. But ours is between a safe vaccine, which is coming very shortly, it’s momentarily, or a devastating lockdown.

It’s always messed up. Sometime he does N1H1. And I say, “No.” But it’s the swine flu. I said, “Just call it the swine flu. It’s easier.” Right? It’s the same thing. Call it the swine flu. That was a catastrophe. And his own Chief of Staff said it was the dumbest run thing they’ve ever done.

He’s a good kid, but he’s a strong kid, but he’s a kid and the immune systems, so they said, Dr. Shaw, and he’s great. He’s White House physician.

Seniors be the first in line to get it, and we will, we’re making it available free, because it’s not your fault that this thing happened. The vaccine, by the way, with or without the vaccine, we’re rounding the turn, but the vaccine makes it go faster. The vaccines are going to be out very soon. Very, very soon.

I say it all the time. In the first three and a half years, what we’ve done with tax cuts and regulation cuts and rebuilding our military, which was totally depleted and a disaster.

We have the best tests. These are things that we never even had six months ago. Now, if I said, “Let’s cut the testing down in half, you’d have half.

If you want a vaccine to kill the virus, a job to support your family, and freedom to live your life to the fullest, you have to vote republican. It’s so important. You have to vote Republican. We’re joined today with some really great people and a man that’s right at the top of that list for me, is Senator Ron Johnson. Thank you, Ron. I’m telling you, you’re lucky to have him.

"President Donald Trump","For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations. Now we are rebuilding, if it’s okay with you, our nation. I ended the NAFTA nightmare and replaced it with a brand new UMSCA. Wisconsin dairy farmers were decimated under the Obama and Biden plan. Just think about it. I only ran because of them. I said that during the debate. I said, “Joe, never thought of this, I ran because of you people, because you did such a bad job.” He had no response to that. With the USMCA, are dairy exports to Canada are expected to surge by more than 100%. Okay? Just went into effect and we’re not going to be losing our companies to Mexico and Canada. We’re not going to have our companies close up and get rid of everybody, fire everybody.

I couldn’t stand watching it and it’s going to be, now, they’re going to pay a tremendous economic price if they do that. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician. They took millions of dollars from the Chinese Communist Party, while Vice President Biden shipped your jobs to China. How the hell can he negotiate with China with the money they take. The news, they don’t want to cover it. The fake media, the lame stream media and the companies, right? These wonderful companies that obviously don’t love our country. It’s suppression.

"President Donald Trump","Where’s Hunter? He wants to know, where’s Hunter? We haven’t found him. He’s still looking for his laptop from hell. That’s where he is. “Where’s my laptop?” “Hunter, you left it at a repair shop. You’d never picked it up.” You know what they go? “Russia did it. Russia, Russia, Russia, Ron it’s Russia. I know it’s Russia.” I saw Adam Schiff, watermelon head, like this. “I believe that Russia caused his problem. Russia.” Yeah. Yeah. Here we go. Russia, Russia, Russia. We have a great head of DNI. He said, “No, it had nothing to do with Russia.” Put out a very strong statement, nothing to do. If it does, we let it know. We let Russia know. But this is pure, disgusting, evil stuff that goes on. Your tech companies don’t want to put it on you. Even the New York Post, which had real courage by the way, and they endorsed me two days ago. That’s [inaudible 00:52:59] But, they had real courage. They took down the New York Post site. Can you believe it? The New York Post, the oldest newspaper in the country, fourth largest of the country. They took down the site. Now, we got to get to the bottom of it. We will, with guys like Kim, we will. When we win, Wisconsin wins. When we win, America wins, and that’s what’s happening. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in US history. We have now built over 400 miles of wall. We’ll soon be finished. They don’t talk about the wall anymore. They don’t tell you. It used to kill me. I’d to go through with, and fight them and we’d close up and we’d do all sorts of things. They would go after me. Once the wall started, once they saw we had all that money lined up to get it done. The impact it’s had is incredible. It’s not completed yet, but it will be very soon. I built it exactly as Border Patrol and ICE wanted it. Exactly. I said, “What about concrete-”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-green-bay-wisconsin-october-30","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Green Bay, Wisconsin October 30","51:58"

And how about that?” I know it all. That’s what I like. They said, “Sir, we want steel. We, then, want concrete inside the steel, and then, we’d like rebar.” I said, “Can you think of a more expensive way, maybe?”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-green-bay-wisconsin-october-30","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Green Bay, Wisconsin October 30","54:03"

The piece of steel on top is four feet deep.” They said, “Sir, that’s called anti-climb. It’s harder to climb.” I gave them everything. Now, they have no excuse. I don’t want to have any excuses. And our numbers on the border are phenomenal, the best we’ve ever had. Joe Biden has pledged to open borders, mass amnesty, nationwide catch-and-release. You know what that is? That’s when you catch a criminal, murderer, rapist, you let the criminal go. We argued about this during the debate. He said, “They all come back for a trial.” No, they don’t come back, Joe. Only the ones, I said, with very low IQs, come back.

Sanctuary cities from coast to coast. They want to have sanctuary cities all over the place, and free healthcare for illegal aliens, which will bankrupt your Medicare and your social security. You will not have social security if you do that or Medicare. We all have a big heart. I do. I want to take care of everybody. The problem is you have millions of people pouring in from all over the world if you do this. As your president, I will protect your borders, I will protect your families, and I will always protect your Medicare and your social security.

He lost, and he went back to the Senate and voted radical left, that he lost again. Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren, all she had to do is get out a couple of days early. He would have won every one of those days, but she decided not to do that. I don’t think she likes Bernie, okay? But Biden will increase refugees. This was agreed with Bernie and the group and AOC plus three, right? Highly educated person on the environment AOC. Have you ever taken a class on the environment? I don’t think so. Increase refugees by 700% from terror hotspots. So, think of that, as 700… This was agreed to. I don’t think Bernie was that bad. I think, actually, Bernie went further left after they made the deal. And I’m keeping radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. Okay?

"President Donald Trump","Look at what’s gone on in France over the four days, what’s happened in France. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military, including nearly $6 billion to save the historic shipyard, Marinette Marine, And even more money for combat vehicle manufacturing in Oshkosh. Marinette’s doing a great job. I went to Marinette four or five months ago, looked at what they were doing. We gave the contract to them, which costs me a lot of states, but that’s okay. But we gave that to Marinette. They do a great job. They do a great job. They were ready to close. A $6 billion contract, and it’s going to be extended. They make the most beautiful ship. You have to say, it looks like a super yacht except it’s got weapons all over it. And I would say, “Paint it gleaming white and call it a yacht. But the weapons sort of throw you off a little bit.” You have more guns and things on that. I’ve never seen anything like it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-green-bay-wisconsin-october-30","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Green Bay, Wisconsin October 30","56:57"

And also, it’s all made in the USA. It’s jobs. It’s great. Best stuff. And you know what? Two and a half trillion dollars. We’re the envy of the world. We’re the envy of Russia and China. Nobody has the equipment that we have, nobody. Stealth fighter jets, F-35s. Can’t see them. Tanks, we have tanks. We have submarines. We have everything. What we’ve done… And nuclear, we’ve upgraded our nuclear. We have new nuclear. And all you do is one thing. You pray that we never have to use it. Okay?

"President Donald Trump","But having it and having it in tippy-top condition is the best way that we will never, ever have to use it. It’s the best way. The last administration’s cruel VA policies resulted in deadly wait lists under Biden and Obama. 300,000 veterans died on a waiting list. To fix this travesty, we passed Veterans’ Choice and VA Accountability, accountability for firing bad people that don’t love our vets and take care of our vets, which you could not do under any circumstances, civil service, unions, whatever. And now, you can do it. Jim, you’re not treating our vets right. Get the hell out of here. You’re fired. Okay, go. All right. Now, our vets, instead of waiting for weeks, sometimes, to see a doctor, they go to a private doctor. We pay the bill.

They actually have become terminally ill waiting for so long. So, now, they get out, immediately see a doctor. And recently, we just got a 91% approval rating for the way we’re running the VA, the vets, from the vets. We killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. We took out the world’s top terrors. Soleimani is dead. Number one terrorist in the world. I went through from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal, $150 billion for nothing. You know what? They gave $150 billion, John Kerry. He’s another genius. What a deal that was. I recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Germany.
