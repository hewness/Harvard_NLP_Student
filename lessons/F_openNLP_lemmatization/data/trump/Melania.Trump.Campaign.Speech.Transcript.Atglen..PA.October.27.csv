"Melania Trump","Thank you, Kellyanne. Hello, Pennsylvania.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/melania-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-atglen-pa-october-27","Melania Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Atglen, PA October 27","00:10"
"Melania Trump","Thank you all for the very warm welcome. And to our friend, Congressman Smucker, for joining us today.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/melania-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-atglen-pa-october-27","Melania Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Atglen, PA October 27","00:17"
"Crowd","We love you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/melania-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-atglen-pa-october-27","Melania Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Atglen, PA October 27","00:33"
"Melania Trump","I love you too. Thank you. Before I begin, thank you for all the love and support you gave us when our family was diagnosed with COVID-19. We are all feeling so much better now thanks to healthy eating and some of the amazing therapeutic options available in our country. Thank you again for your well wishes.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/melania-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-atglen-pa-october-27","Melania Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Atglen, PA October 27","00:33"
"Melania Trump","Since early this year, our country has felt the effects of global pandemic. Like many of you, I have experienced the firsthand effects of COVID-19, not only as a patient, but as a worried mother and wife. I know there are many people who have lost loved ones or know people who have been forever impacted by this silent enemy. My family’s thoughts and prayers are with all of you through this difficult time. We all know the American spirit is stronger than this virus. We have proven that we can and will overcome this unexpected challenge.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/melania-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-atglen-pa-october-27","Melania Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Atglen, PA October 27","00:59"
"Crowd","Amen.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/melania-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-atglen-pa-october-27","Melania Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Atglen, PA October 27","01:48"
"Melania Trump","Thank you to all who have stepped up and help in this uncertain time. To the frontline workers, teachers, healthcare professionals, and many more, my husband and I are grateful to you. You continue to make a difference every single day. Such selfless service is what our American values are all about. It’s amazing to see the way we as Americans have come together in this time of need. Through the passionate and careful work being done in our communities, cities, and states all across our beautiful and powerful country, we will triumph over this virus.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/melania-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-atglen-pa-october-27","Melania Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Atglen, PA October 27","01:48"
"Melania Trump","Donald is a fighter. He loves this country and he fights for you every single day. For the first time in history, the citizens of this country get to hear directly and instantly from their president every single day through social media. I do not always agree with the way he says things but it is important to him that he speaks directly to the people he serves. This administration chooses to keep moving forward during this pandemic, not backward. By moving forward, we demonstrate a fundamental value of our nation. Our ability to rise to any challenge and overcome any hurdle. We do not close down or hide in fear. We get to work to find real and lasting solutions. It’s what sets us apart from any other country in the world.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/melania-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-atglen-pa-october-27","Melania Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Atglen, PA October 27","02:54"
"Melania Trump","It’s how we came from 13 small colonies to the global leader. Our schools, restaurants, and business, large or small, have developed safer ways for people to continue moving forward. Our administration remains 100% supportive of ensuring our nation is equipped with all the medical supplies we need and getting a vaccine developed and distributed safely and quickly as possible. This is something that both political parties should support, encourage, and celebrate. No one should be promoting fear of real solutions for purely political ends.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/melania-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-atglen-pa-october-27","Melania Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Atglen, PA October 27","04:16"
"Melania Trump","The success of a vaccine will save millions of lives over the long term. I believe in our incredible doctors, nurses, medical professionals, and scientists. The Democrats have chosen to put their own agendas ahead of the American people’s wellbeing. Instead, they attempt to create a divide, a divide on something that should be nonpartisan and non-controversial. A divide that causes confusion and fear instead of hope and security. That is not leadership. Let us also not forget what the Democrats chose to focus on when COVID-19 first came into our country.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/melania-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-atglen-pa-october-27","Melania Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Atglen, PA October 27","05:19"
"Melania Trump","While the President was taking decisive action to keep the American people safe, the Democrats were wasting American taxpayer dollars in a sham impeachment. They cared more about removing our elected president. Meanwhile, I watched Donald continue to work hard to keep people informed and calm, to protect our economy and make hard and unpopular decisions to the do all he could do to keep us all safe. This sham was led by opposition and their display of hatred is on display to this day. Children watching and learning about politics in our country deserve a better display of political responsibility and respect for our sacred institutions.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/melania-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-atglen-pa-october-27","Melania Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Atglen, PA October 27","06:13"
"Melania Trump","Joe Biden attacked President Trump’s decision to put the American people first and closing travel from China. He called it xenophobic hysteria. Now he suggest that he could have done a better job. The American people can look at Joe Biden’s 36 years in Congress and eight years in the Vice Presidency and determine whether they think he will finally be able to get something done for the American people.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/melania-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-atglen-pa-october-27","Melania Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Atglen, PA October 27","07:25"
"Melania Trump","On November 3rd, when you vote, you’re voting for our children’s futures. As long as Donald Trump is President, our American family values and the virtues that our country was built upon will continue to be cherished and upheld. The Democrats with help from the media have worked tirelessly to all but destroy our traditional values. Before my husband decided to run for President, the media loved him because they saw the man that I see every day. Someone tough, successful, and fair.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/melania-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-atglen-pa-october-27","Melania Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Atglen, PA October 27","08:07"
"Crowd","And handsome.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/melania-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-atglen-pa-october-27","Melania Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Atglen, PA October 27","09:01"
"Melania Trump","I agree. A man who sees potential in everyone he meets, no matter their gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation. A man who has a very big heart and have a great sense of humor. Donald loves helping people and he loves seeing those around him and his country succeed. But when he decided to run for the President as a Republican, the media created a different picture of my husband, one I don’t recognize, and treated all his supporters with equal disdain. The media has chosen to focus on stories of idle gossip and palace intrigue by editorializing real events and policies with their own bias and agendas.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/melania-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-atglen-pa-october-27","Melania Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Atglen, PA October 27","09:03"
"Melania Trump","For instance, my initiative Be Best has one main goal, helping children. Yet the media have chosen to take the attention away from children and focus on only the negative. But that will not stop me to do what is right. Like my husband, we are not the politicians who have worked in Washington for too long. And just like my husband, I’m here to make a difference for you and your families. It has been the greatest honor and privilege to serve as the first lady of the amazing country.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/melania-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-atglen-pa-october-27","Melania Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Atglen, PA October 27","10:12"
"Crowd","Four more years. Four more years.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/melania-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-atglen-pa-october-27","Melania Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Atglen, PA October 27","11:20"
"Melania Trump","It has allowed me an opportunity unlike any other. I have met with children all around the country and the world. What I know is that all children understand the language of love. I have seen a great deal of love through simple, everyday acts of kindness. In fact, it was a little boy from this great state of Pennsylvania who helped show what it meant to be the best. Christian [Box 00:12:04] was in second grade when he created his buddy bench. When Christian notice some of his schoolmates were lonely, he decided to create a bench where children could sit at recess and connect with other children. Christian’s simple act helped address children’s feelings of loneliness, and it allowed for many new friendships to forum.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/melania-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-atglen-pa-october-27","Melania Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Atglen, PA October 27","11:33"
"Melania Trump","These are the acts Be Best will continue sharing with the American people so that children everywhere can understand the power of kindness. Remember, it is love of optimism, not fear and lawlessness that will make America great again. There is so much goodness and compassion happening, but oftentimes it does not make the news. That drives the news are the handpicked, angry, and often baseless claims from anonymous sources and angry ex-employees who are only trying to distract from the important work happening inside the White House. These next four years are vital. Our president continues to move this country forward. The United States is a country of hope, not the country of fear.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/melania-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-atglen-pa-october-27","Melania Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Atglen, PA October 27","12:32"
"Melania Trump","Under Donald’s leadership, our economy has soared, our borders are safer, we have stayed out of new conflicts, and worked to end wars. We have destroyed terrorists who attack this country and our allies under the last administration and have made historic peace deals in the Middle East which makes the world safer. We are respected again. We still have a strong alliances around the world and these allies are now doing their fair share globally.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/melania-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-atglen-pa-october-27","Melania Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Atglen, PA October 27","13:48"
"Melania Trump","As a mother, I’m grateful for a President who believes in strong families. As an independent woman, I’m grateful for a President who has championed not only women, but working mothers, by promoting and supporting their roles in the workforce. As an American, I’m proud that we have a President who puts our country first. Remember, we are a strong nation. With Donald Trump as our President, we will be even stronger when we beat COVID-19.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/melania-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-atglen-pa-october-27","Melania Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Atglen, PA October 27","14:33"
"Melania Trump","Please remember to follow CDC guidelines so that together we can minimize the spread of the virus until a vaccine can be developed. This election isn’t just about the next year. It’s about the next four years and beyond. It’s about continuing to set this country on a course of real prosperity and success. We can’t and we shouldn’t go backwards. Donald Trump is the man who will lead us and empower us to make that greater future together. Donald Trump will expand and grow the economy and keep us safe.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/melania-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-atglen-pa-october-27","Melania Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Atglen, PA October 27","15:30"
"Melania Trump","Joe Biden’s policy and socialist agenda will only serve to destroy America and all that has been built in the past four years. We must keep Donald in the White House so he can finish what he started and our country can continue to flourish. Thank you for taking time out of your day to be here with me. And thank you for all of your support. If you haven’t already voted, please be sure to get out and vote on November 3rd and encourage everyone you know to do the same. God bless you, each of you, your families, and God bless our beautiful nation.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/melania-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-atglen-pa-october-27","Melania Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Atglen, PA October 27","16:20"
