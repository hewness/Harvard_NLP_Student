"Rush Limbaugh","And greetings to you music lovers, thrill seekers, and conversationalists all across the fruited plain. Welcome to the Rush Limbaugh program. Mr. President, it is a distinct honor and privilege to have you with us, and I want you to do something for me, sir.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rush-limbaugh-interview-radio-rally-transcript-october-9","Donald Trump Rush Limbaugh Interview “Radio Rally” Transcript October 9","03:06"

"Rush Limbaugh","I want you to imagine you have just landed in a gleaming majestic Air Force One, to the largest radio rally in history. Instead of thousands cheering as you walk up to the stage, there are millions and millions of patriots out there right now anxiously awaiting to hear from you. No doubt, they’re waving Trump flags, wearing their bright red MAGA hats proudly. This, sir, is a mega MAGA rally. And we are all thrilled to be with you today, we are so glad you’re doing better. And welcome to the EIB Network.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rush-limbaugh-interview-radio-rally-transcript-october-9","Donald Trump Rush Limbaugh Interview “Radio Rally” Transcript October 9","03:20"
"Donald Trump","Well, I want to thank you Rush, you’re a fantastic man, a friend of mine. But before I really even knew you as a friend, you were a supporter. And I said, “I know that guy, he’s got a big audience.” But I never even knew the importance of what you do and what you say, and now I do very well. And it keeps us all in the game. And we just got great polls out of, you probably heard, out of Arizona, we’re getting them out of Nevada. The real polls, not the fake polls. We’re getting them out of North Carolina, looking really good. I think Pennsylvania is looking good. Florida is looking great. It’s all a big phony deal they have going Rush, and we’re going to win this. I think it’s going to be a bigger win than we had four years ago.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rush-limbaugh-interview-radio-rally-transcript-october-9","Donald Trump Rush Limbaugh Interview “Radio Rally” Transcript October 9","03:53"
"Rush Limbaugh","Oh, that would be great. [crosstalk 00:04:36]. Mr. President, I have to tell you, from the moment that your appearance was announced, we’ve received… We’ve never had a response like this, sir. I’m in my 32nd year, we have never had a response like, we’ve had thousands and thousands of questions and comments for you. I hope you know how deeply loved you are by so many Americans who have invested their hopes and prayers for this country in you. They want to see you in the White House for four more years. And I’ll tell you what I want. I want them to get to know you as I do. I want them to know that Donald Trump that I know. You are one of the strongest, the most unwavering, the most determined, loyal people I’ve ever met. But you care deeply about the country. You care about everybody. And it’s just a breathtaking thing. The difference in you as portrayed in the media, and who you really are, is breathtaking. Today, I want people to get to know the Donald Trump that I know.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rush-limbaugh-interview-radio-rally-transcript-october-9","Donald Trump Rush Limbaugh Interview “Radio Rally” Transcript October 9","04:34"
"Donald Trump","Well, I appreciate it. And when you suggested this, I immediately jumped on it because your audiences is the biggest. I mean, it’s just incredible. And we have some great friends in Sean Hannity, and so many others, and Mark, and so many people are so great to us. But we have so many people that are so untruthful. And the biggest thing, and the one thing I haven’t figured out is why. If we say we’re going to create a strong military and protect, we’re going to create a strong economy like we’ve never had an economy prior to the plague, and that we’re building it up again stronger than before. Watch, it’s going to be stronger than before. We’re almost at record stock market. Nobody can believe that. And we’re rounding the turn on the pandemic, and I’ll have something to say about that. Because I’m telling you, we have a cure. More than just a therapeutic. We have a cure.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rush-limbaugh-interview-radio-rally-transcript-october-9","Donald Trump Rush Limbaugh Interview “Radio Rally” Transcript October 9","05:46"
"Donald Trump","But so many things that we’ve done, and no matter what you do, they try and find fault. And not only fault, vicious, they’re vicious people. And you say, why wouldn’t they want to have good education, a good military, a strong economy, safety, security? Why would they want to live like they live in Portland, and where they just allow these agitators and anarchists to run the streets? Why would they want that? That’s the only thing I haven’t figured out. Why would they? And why would these big companies like Comcast, I call it Concast. It’s Comcast, but I call it Concast because it’s a con job. That’s NBC mostly. But if you look at that or CNN, which is so pathetic, why would they do that? Why would they want to have a country that’s in turmoil? Because they create it. The fake news is the worst thing we have going. The lame stream, I call it the lame stream media. But you’d think that they’d want to see great education, great country, great security, strong military.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rush-limbaugh-interview-radio-rally-transcript-october-9","Donald Trump Rush Limbaugh Interview “Radio Rally” Transcript October 9","06:34"

"Donald Trump","It’s a crazy thing, Rush. It’s the one thing I’ve never quite figured it out, you know? And they become less wealthy. To a large extent, they become less wealthy. And they’re willing to give up their wealth in order to see the country go to hell. Some day when you figure that out, you’re going to let me know. Okay, [crosstalk 00:07:52]-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rush-limbaugh-interview-radio-rally-transcript-october-9","Donald Trump Rush Limbaugh Interview “Radio Rally” Transcript October 9","07:36"
"Rush Limbaugh","I’ll tell you. I’ll tell you today. I know exactly what this is. We’ve got a lot of questions for you from members of the audience. So before we dive into those, I need to ask you something that I’ve not really had a chance to ask you prior. Before you did this, before 2015 when you came down the escalator and announced you’re a candidate, you had a storybook life. You had an absolutely fabulous life. You had a life that anybody would aspire to. You were very successful. You were happy. You were a media darling. They loved you back then. Why did you decide to run for president and put up with the day in and day out maligning that you get? Because you did not have to do this.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rush-limbaugh-interview-radio-rally-transcript-october-9","Donald Trump Rush Limbaugh Interview “Radio Rally” Transcript October 9","07:52"
"Donald Trump","I’ll tell you, it’s such a great question. And I’d do it again, even though it’s far worse. I never thought I’d be involved with a Russia hoax or a Ukraine hoax, or be impeached because I made a phone call congratulating somebody that I never met to or spoke to on becoming the President of Ukraine. And all of a sudden you get impeached. And it was a perfect phone call. A letter that we actually… Fortunately, we had it transcribed, because they made up the phone call. They said it was totally different. Fortunately, or maybe I wouldn’t be talking to you right now in this capacity at least, fortunately we had it transcribed. It was transcribed, the exact call. If we didn’t, you know what Schiff said, he said it before Congress, he repeated my call. It had no bearing on what I said.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rush-limbaugh-interview-radio-rally-transcript-october-9","Donald Trump Rush Limbaugh Interview “Radio Rally” Transcript October 9","08:33"
"Donald Trump","It was a perfect phone call, and I got impeached over it. I never knew it would be so unpleasant. But nobody has done more in the last three and a half years as president, in the first three and a half years that I have. Nobody. I mean, if you look at rebuilding the military and the economy, and the best employment numbers we’ve ever had. And we’ve cut regulations to a point that’s so incredible nobody’s ever seen. If you look at the Veterans Choice and the VA Accountability, we had people in the VA that would beat up our veterans, and beat them up badly. You know, they’re infirm, they’re not well, they’re not feeling well. And then you had these animals in there that would beat them up, we couldn’t do anything about them. Now with accountability, you have to account. And we fire them, and worse, we get rid of them.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rush-limbaugh-interview-radio-rally-transcript-october-9","Donald Trump Rush Limbaugh Interview “Radio Rally” Transcript October 9","09:17"
"Donald Trump","And our vets have a 91% approval rating, the highest we’ve ever had in the VA. You don’t hear those bad stories about the VA anymore like he used to. And now they get immediate doctor attention, if they have to wait on line. I mean, but that’s so many different things. Right to try, where they can try medicines. And I mean, I can give you an example of that with the COVID. Because I was in not great shape, and we have a medicine that healed me, that fixed me. It’s a great medicine. And had I not gotten it, Rush, it would have been in line for another year probably before they brought it out. Great company, two great companies actually make it, make very similar things. But they both work equally well. And we’re going to send it, we’re already sending it and starting the processes.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rush-limbaugh-interview-radio-rally-transcript-october-9","Donald Trump Rush Limbaugh Interview “Radio Rally” Transcript October 9","10:04"
"Donald Trump","Hundreds of thousands of vials are being sent to the hospitals all over the country. People are going to get immediately better, like I did. I mean, I feel better now than I did two weeks ago. It’s crazy. And I recovered immediately, almost immediately. I might not have recovered at all from COVID. To me, it’s the biggest story, but the press doesn’t even want to report that. They talk about the vaccines, and the vaccines are very important, Rush. But this is more important because we can go into hospitals and clean out the hospitals, literally, with people that… The vaccines are very important, it’s just a different stage.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rush-limbaugh-interview-radio-rally-transcript-october-9","Donald Trump Rush Limbaugh Interview “Radio Rally” Transcript October 9","10:50"

"Donald Trump","… antibody. This is the antibody. And Regeneron, it’s the most unbelievable thing I’ve ever seen. And I had a meeting with doctors today. It’s always the good thing about when you’re president, 11 doctors show up and they’re all the head of Johns Hopkins and this and that. They’re great people. But Walter Reed is an incredible place. And these 11 guys came in today, they showed me stats. It’s amazing. I don’t know that I would have… I was not in the greatest of shape, a day later I was fine, maybe perfect. But I was fine. But a couple of days later, now I’m free. I feel perfect. I’m not taking anything, I’m off any regimen that they gave me. But it was primarily this one drug.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rush-limbaugh-interview-radio-rally-transcript-october-9","Donald Trump Rush Limbaugh Interview “Radio Rally” Transcript October 9","11:27"
"Donald Trump","And we’re sending that and the Eli Lilly version of it, which is very similar, we’re sending that to all of our hospitals. We’re going to get people better. We got to get it there fast, that’s why I’m doing an emergency use authorization, I got to get them to approve it really fast. But I gave them my numbers to put in with the other numbers that they already have, which are very good. Excellent. And it’s the most amazing thing. And it’s not Remdesivir, maybe that helps a little bit. But Remdesivir is not the same thing. This is stuff that is so good, it just wiped out the virus. It wiped it out.

"Rush Limbaugh","It was scary when we heard that you had tested positive, given your demographics. You were right there in the number one target area for people that have trouble with this. And you sound great. I’ve been [crosstalk 00:13:07] reading that you got a hacking cough, and that your voice is hoarse. You sound perfectly normal to me.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rush-limbaugh-interview-radio-rally-transcript-october-9","Donald Trump Rush Limbaugh Interview “Radio Rally” Transcript October 9","12:52"
"Donald Trump","Well there’s always that little lingering thing for a couple of days, but no, my voice is now perfect. I mean, for a couple of days you have, it’s called the lingering thing. If you have hay fever, if you have something, you have that too a wee little bit. But no, this is the most amazing thing that’s happened. And I was asking the doctors today, 11 guys, great people, the heads of the biggest hospitals. It’s amazing. I guess the President has a lot of power, but everybody shows up. What do you do? I’m the head of Johns Hopkins. Or, I’m the head of stuff. But they’re very brilliant people. And I said, “How bad was I?” They said, “You could have been very bad. You were going into a very bad phase.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rush-limbaugh-interview-radio-rally-transcript-october-9","Donald Trump Rush Limbaugh Interview “Radio Rally” Transcript October 9","13:14"
"Donald Trump","And so it wasn’t like it was just going to, like with the kids where they get it and it get sniffles and they’re better two days later, right? This looks like it was going to be a big deal. And you know what that means, right? That means bad. Because I’ve lost five people, at least five people that were friends of mine. One in particular, an incredible guy who went in there. Went into the hospital, he was dead within three days. And I’m just saying that we have something that will cure this now. And a cure. And without us, without Trump administration, this would never have happened. We poured money into these cures, and we poured money into the vaccines. And the vaccines are coming along great, Rush. I mean the vaccines, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer. They’re all coming along great. A little bit political, they’re afraid it’s going to go too fast and I’ll get credit for it before the election.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rush-limbaugh-interview-radio-rally-transcript-october-9","Donald Trump Rush Limbaugh Interview “Radio Rally” Transcript October 9","13:55"
"Rush Limbaugh","Well that’s another thing I wanted to… Mr. President, you have been forced, because of media coverage, to tout your own successes. You have been forced to tout, like you just did in the past five minutes here. And it rubs some people the wrong way, they think you’re bragging. They think that you’re insecure. That you need to constantly… Would you explain to people why you find it necessary to tout your successes, rather than let somebody in the White House or a PR type operation do it for you? Why do you find it necessary to do yourself?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rush-limbaugh-interview-radio-rally-transcript-october-9","Donald Trump Rush Limbaugh Interview “Radio Rally” Transcript October 9","14:43"

"Donald Trump","That’s right. He didn’t know. He couldn’t explain why he got it, but I can. And one is Middle East peace without any blood. Okay. And by the way, countries are lining up. The other is, if you look at Kosovo and Serbia, they’ve been killing each other forever. And I got them to be peace and good stuff. And then I just heard about the third. Nobody even wrote it. It wasn’t even on the news, okay? I joke about it in speeches sometimes, I’ll joke about it. I say, “I tell my wife, let’s watch tonight. It’ll be a wonderful night.” And they don’t even cover it. They don’t cover any good stuff with me. Anything that’s good they don’t cover. Anything that’s okay, or bad. I mean, bad, they make it sound like let’s do the electric chair thing. But it is the most dishonest…","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rush-limbaugh-interview-radio-rally-transcript-october-9","Donald Trump Rush Limbaugh Interview “Radio Rally” Transcript October 9","15:40"
"Donald Trump","The media are the most dishonest people I’ve ever met. And that’s why I go back to the original. I just don’t know why. I mean, they can’t hate somebody so much, but I guess they do. But they do it with Republican conservatives. I mean, you’ve had it before I came along. But I don’t think never to this extent. You know they say, that Newt Gingrich, they said that the one that got worse than me was Abraham Lincoln. I said, “I disagree.” They say Abraham Lincoln was just decimated by the press. I said, “Maybe he was, but it couldn’t be worse.” If I do something good, they make it look bad. If I do something okay, they make it look horrible, horrible.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rush-limbaugh-interview-radio-rally-transcript-october-9","Donald Trump Rush Limbaugh Interview “Radio Rally” Transcript October 9","16:26"

If I give it to our very good people, Kayleigh, and we have a lot of good people at the White House. If I give it to them to go out, they won’t report it.

"Rush Limbaugh","Well in a way, they are. I think they have been poisoned, to an extent. And I mean this, folks. Poisoned by their own hatred. This is not the original reason, but we’re into four years now that they have tried everything they know to get rid of you. And not a single thing, not a single weapon has worked. These people, if they want to Mr. President, and Newt’s an example, they’re able to take out Sarah Palins. They’re able to take out and destroy any Republican they choose. It took them seven years to finally ruin George W. Bush and his reputation, the war in Iraq. But they did it. They got his approval numbers down to the 30s. You, in Zogby today, are still at 51. They haven’t landed a dent, sir. They have not taken you off of your agenda. They’ve maybe distracted you for now and then, but they haven’t stopped it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rush-limbaugh-interview-radio-rally-transcript-october-9","Donald Trump Rush Limbaugh Interview “Radio Rally” Transcript October 9","17:39"
"Rush Limbaugh","They can’t believe it. They’re throwing everything. And so they are doubling down on doing whatever they can to try to get rid of you, just to prove that they can. And it’s frustrating as heck that they haven’t been able to. It’s an amazing thing. And I’m like you, I watch this coverage and I ask, how many of the American people realize, without being told, how basically dishonest and unfair this all is? And you hope that a majority of Americans see it for what it is and react accordingly. But I tell you, it’s that, and the fact that you’re an outsider. They never thought you were going to win. They didn’t even think you wanted to win, they thought you were engaged in a PR stunt in the first place.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rush-limbaugh-interview-radio-rally-transcript-october-9","Donald Trump Rush Limbaugh Interview “Radio Rally” Transcript October 9","18:32"

"Rush Limbaugh","Then you’re also implementing policies, sir, that they detest. Your agenda is a small government. Well, it was before the pandemic hit. Your agenda is basically pro freedom, pro liberty, pro the American citizen first. You want to make America… Can you believe, make America great again is controversial? Who in the world could find a problem with that? These sick people have found a way. Make America great again, is reason to destroy you?

"Donald Trump","Well Rush, remember how big the wall was? Everything was the wall, the wall, the wall, and it got bigger and bigger because they figured it was no way to get it financed because it’s massive. You know it’s thousands of miles. The whole thing is, it’s a massive project. It’s one of the biggest. It’s actually one of the biggest projects, government projects ever. Anyway, so we’re building the wall, we’re up to 380 miles of wall. Had a huge impact. Nobody gets through this wall. This wall is everything the border patrol wanted. I built it exactly. I didn’t even agree with them on certain parts of it, but I think they were right. They had to have see-through. They had to have this, they had to have that. It’s lined up with all sorts of wires and everything, you can imagine. It is the best.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rush-limbaugh-interview-radio-rally-transcript-october-9","Donald Trump Rush Limbaugh Interview “Radio Rally” Transcript October 9","19:47"
"Donald Trump","Okay? It’s the best. And it’s had an impact that you wouldn’t believe. And nobody thought I was going to get it done. Now it’s almost completed, it will be completed toward the end of the year. Very soon. And it will be about 535 miles. We may have even extended beyond that. But you have a lot of natural barriers, rivers, and mountains and other things that really do a pretty good job. But we’re going to have it finished very soon. You don’t even hear about it anymore. And you don’t hear about how great the border numbers are. People today, I ended catch and release, which was not easy. Because I had to go through the Democrats. You used to catch somebody, they’d release them into our country. And they’d come back four years later, but nobody would ever come back for a court case.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rush-limbaugh-interview-radio-rally-transcript-october-9","Donald Trump Rush Limbaugh Interview “Radio Rally” Transcript October 9","20:26"
"Donald Trump","It was the craziest thing. You’d catch somebody, even a murderer, and then you’d release them into our country. And then you’d say, you have to be back here in two and a half years to go to trial. And nobody would come back, only the very dumbest would come back. Okay? And that was about 1%. No, that was about 1%. And it was crazy, catch and release. I mean, there were many programs like that, we got rid of most of them. And it’s not easy to get rid of them, you had to go through all sorts of hoops. But I got rid of catch and release. We have a very good border now. Now only people that come in legally are coming in. Well, the wall made a tremendous difference.

And then my guy said, “Why bring it up, sir? You have the same policies that you’re already implementing.

We’ve got a couple hard liners out there, friends of yours. But the people that wanted the wall, I’ve done far more than I thought. Our immigration now, because it wasn’t just the wall, it’s the wall, but we had to cut a lot of these crazy things out.

And through chain migration, the chain, he brings in his mother, his father, his grandmother, his aunts, his brothers, his uncles. He brings in all these people. And I say, “Wait a minute.” And what we’ve done is incredible, on immigration. Think of it, you have killers that come in, and because of chain migration they’re allowed to bring other people.

But the people in California, they don’t like sanctuary cities. What are you doing with a sanctuary? You’re protecting criminals. Who wants that? And I’ve had so many people, liberal friends of mine from California. “We’d love to get rid of sanctuary cities.” Well that thug from, as you know, Kate’s Law. Remember Kate’s Law, [crosstalk 00:24:19] which should have been… We tried like hell to get it passed. We left the filibuster, okay? We should have gotten rid of the filibuster.

Hopefully that’ll go quickly. I think she’s going to go very quickly. So I have three Supreme Court judges. But in the first term, they’ll go nuclear, as you know. And that’ll be the end of the filibuster. And they’ll approve stuff left and right, 50%, they’ll go left and right. And that’s the problem I had with it. It’s not that they’re not right, they did it the right way. Harry Reed, we got lucky because Harry Reed thought that Hillary was going to win. And he knocked out the filibuster for the judges.

It’s just the fact that you came along and totally upended their grand plans for globalism, changing the way our nation’s affairs are run and organized. You really just upset the applecart in ways they never dreamed possible. They thought the Hillary administration was going to be Obama’s third term, and you’ve just totally thrown them upside down. Now this leads me to another thing. I go back and I compare the 2016 campaign. And at that point, you don’t have a record.

First in 75 years, right? A new branch of the United States military. That, by itself, is an achievement that you could just do that and you’ve had a successful thing. Space Force, think of it.

These fake polls, I don’t know if you have a look at them. I don’t even know why they have to put it down, I think there’s a legal reason.

We have some great ones, you know that. Jim Jordan and Meadows has been great. A lot of them. A lot of them have been great. But the Republicans have to get tougher. The Democrats play a much dirtier game. Like impeaching on a phone call. I’ll never forget, “Sir, did you call the President of Ukraine?” “Yeah, I did.

Right? Think of what that means. If the person on the other side of the call, if you did it once, maybe. Twice, maybe. If you did it eight times, I think you’re certifiably insane. Right?

Explain to us, what are we supposed to…” In other words, after having read the call they’ll say, “What the hell is wrong with this thing. Right?” They impeached me.

We talk about unity, because I’d like to see the country come together. It’s not as easy as people think.

This is our second-most-mentioned topic that people want to hear you address. “Mr. President, it drives me crazy that the Democrats can call all of us out here racist and sexist just because we don’t agree with them. It’s the easiest thing in the world to call somebody racist because nobody wants to be racist or anti anything, and we aren’t racist. Why do Democrats get away with it, sir, and how do Republicans say enough is enough? We are tired of being called evil racists when all we want is for all Americans to be free, to have the blessed opportunity this Constitution and country offers everybody. We want a healthy and safe future, and we love everybody. How do we deal with this, sir?

When they give up, when we’re beating them, they have nothing else to fall back on but the word racist. That means that when you’re winning and you’re just knocking the hell out of them, they have nothing else to say; they call you a racist. This has been going on for decades. I don’t know that you’re going to stop it, but people are wise to it and people are rolling their eyes now. They’re rolling their eyes. It is just an incredible thing. The way they use the racist word is actually disgusting. I was asked by Chris Wallace, who’s third-rate, I was asked by him… He was protecting Biden the other night. It was pathetic. I couldn’t even ask him, “Why did you get $3.5 million from the mayor’s wife of Moscow? Why did you say, ‘A billion dollars unless you get rid of the prosecutor,’ and then you give them the billion dollars?” He was choking like a dog.

"Rush Limbaugh","I want to back the President up on this, folks. In this story that we’re talking about here, the Russian collusion meddling story, do not doubt me, there wasn’t a word of truth in any of the stories that republished oftentimes four times a day for the first year. There was no truth. When Robert Mueller was handed the file on the day he became the Special Counsel, it was empty. There was never any evidence. This was not an investigation. There was nothing to investigate. It was a hunt. It was an outrage. And to be awarded a Pulitzer Prize for printing not a single thing that is true is genuinely discrediting the Pulitzer. And you would think these people would care about that, but they don’t. All it matters is getting rid of you. That’s all that matters.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rush-limbaugh-interview-radio-rally-transcript-october-9","Donald Trump Rush Limbaugh Interview “Radio Rally” Transcript October 9","01:11:35"

We’re going to have to remand, we’re going to have to take back the prizes.” But Rush, think of it. They were totally wrong and they all got Pulitzer Prizes. And then they go into another story, it’s the same stuff. It’s so disgraceful when you look at what’s gone on. It’s so dishonest and they knew it. And Mueller was a fraud.

You’ve gone through three and a half years of investigations. They found nothing.” And they’ve gotten through my taxes. They’ve gone through everything. Hey, they spent $48 million, I think the last number I heard was, $48 million investigating me. They’ve gone through my taxes. They’ve gone through everything you can imagine at a level that nobody can even believe. Nobody’s ever had to put up and no other President should have to put up with this. But then I hear that they’re not going to do the thing before the election. Why? Because they’re afraid they’re going to influence the election. Because that’s the way that Republicans are.

They have made people doubt, and they’re now talking about how this upcoming election the Russians are in the process of stealing it too. These people are so dishonorable and disreputable and they need to be made to be held accountable of what they have done to the perception of honesty and integrity in our elections to the very serious effort they are making to transform this country into something it was never founded to be.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rush-limbaugh-interview-radio-rally-transcript-october-9","Donald Trump Rush Limbaugh Interview “Radio Rally” Transcript October 9","01:15:58"

And by the way, speaking of that and speaking to Bill Barr, 31 people deleted their telephone messages from the Mueller Report. And they said they all made a mistake. Well, they made the same mistake. The chances are a billion to one that they would have made the same mistake. 31 phones were wiped clean on the Mueller Report. I want to see those phones. And how do you allow 31 phones? I think it was 19 people, 31 phones, you read about it just recently. They want the phones because they want the information on the phones because we caught them cheating. And they were all wiped, clean. Or most of them were wiped clean.

But if you look at the polls, most polls say I won it with him. But it was a very interesting thing. I’d rather let him speak because he’s gone, he’s mentally gone, and eventually he goes off track and he’ll start talking about the birds and the bees. But I couldn’t do that because he was saying so many false things. He’d say about the soldiers, he’d say about social security, which I’ll protect and he won’t protect, by the way.

"Donald Trump","There’s something wrong with him, and nobody wants to say it. Nobody wants to say it, but he can’t… His thoughts are bad… Here’s a guy, you talk about access to the press. I’ve never seen this before, and I’ve watched a lot and I don’t know how it gets away. You saw that NBC joke the other night where there’s… It’s like a child. Like you’re asking a child questions. They don’t talk to me that way. When you look at the questions that he gets, and then he reads the answers off a computer. Now that means that these supposedly legitimate, but they’re not legitimate… You know that better than I do… These news organizations are giving him questions, they’re putting them in a computer, he’s reading the answers off a computer.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rush-limbaugh-interview-radio-rally-transcript-october-9","Donald Trump Rush Limbaugh Interview “Radio Rally” Transcript October 9","01:41:52"

He’s reading the answers off a computer a lot of times. And if he doesn’t do that, he’s all mixed up and befuddled. And Chris Wallace saved him three times the other night. I mean, he was getting ready to crack, and Chris Wallace… Who was terrible by the way, who I think really embarrassed himself and Fox the other night. But Chris Wallace saved him.

The man who found it estimates 70 to 80 pounds of mail. USPS, the postal services investigating. And then we have another companion story. Mail-in ballots in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania have been delayed. Voters are confused and frustrated. 58,000 mail-in ballots… One County, sir, in one state, extrapolate that to the entire state… 58,000 mail-in ballots, or as the Democrats see it, mail-in fraud.

Who are they sending them to? Where are they going? Et cetera, et cetera. This is going to be the second biggest political scandal in history.

How about where they have the ballots counted and the ballots have to be in by November 3rd election day, but they don’t have to be counted for two weeks later. Well, that means you’re never going to know who won the election. It’s going to be two weeks later? I want to see you on November 3rd, who won the election. So do you. You want to turn on your television, like we have for the last 50 years and find out who won the election, right? You don’t want to say, “Oh, gee, they have two weeks to count their ballots.” And then what happens is all sorts of ballots starts showing up miraculously.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rush-limbaugh-interview-radio-rally-transcript-october-9","Donald Trump Rush Limbaugh Interview “Radio Rally” Transcript October 9","01:47:20"

We just won a big case in Pennsylvania, I think we’re going to win. We’re winning a lot of cases… Rhode Island, won a big case… where the ballots have to be done in a certain way, but the best way is to get up… Now, I tell you what. Our people, your people, my people, Republican people, they get out… And they’re all my people as far as… Everyone’s my people, but Republicans tend to get out and vote. And that’s what they should do. Early voting, but at a machine. Early voting or voting on November 3rd.

"Donald Trump","But the Democrats are sending an 80% of theirs by ballot. Now, one thing we’ve noticed from what I hear and from what I’m reading, is a lot of the ballots, all they’re doing is taking from people that would have voted in the first place. So not a lot of new voters. We have many more registered voters than we’ve… We’ve picked up a lot of voters, the Republicans. I think you’re going to see a very, very big explosion when those polls open up, Rush. But a large percentage, like 80% of the Republicans want to vote. They want to actually go to a poll and vote. Whereas it’s almost the opposite, for whatever reason, with the Democrats.
