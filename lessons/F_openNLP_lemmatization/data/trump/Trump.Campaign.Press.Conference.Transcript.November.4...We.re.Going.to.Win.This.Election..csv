"Eric Trump","There is video after video of them passing out collateral material in polling sites all over Philadelphia. They’re trying to cheat. They’re trying to cheat. They have three by five printed, big posters in polling locations, all over the city, saying to vote for Biden and Harris, which is totally illegal. They’re passing out flyers. The supervisors of elections, we have them on video, certain ones wearing literally Biden Harris face masks in polling locations, which is totally illegal. And now they won’t let, and we brought one great gentleman here with us today, Jeremy, who’s a poll watcher down at the convention center. They won’t even let him watch as they count the ballots. They put them behind a fence, 40, 50 yards away where they actually can’t see the counting happening. Guys, this is fraud. This is absolute fraud. We’ve seen it in Philadelphia before. They’re trying to make a mockery of the election of this country.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/trump-campaign-press-conference-transcript-november-4-were-going-to-win-this-election","Trump Campaign Press Conference Transcript November 4: “We’re Going to Win This Election”","timed text issue"
"Eric Trump","My father is up by almost half a million votes in this state, with 86% reported and plenty of red counties left to go, plenty of red counties left to go. We’re going to win Pennsylvania, but they’re trying to cheat us out of it because they know it’s their only path to victory. They know it’s the only path to victory. And so we came here today. We met with all our lawyers. We are going to file suit in Pennsylvania. It’s a shame that we have to do that. It’s the last thing that we wanted to do. It’s the last thing my father wanted to do, but this is rampant corruption and it can’t happen. It’s simply can’t happen. It’s not fair. This isn’t democracy. And with that, I want to pass it off to the great Rudy Giuliani. Who’s really leading the legal effort and you’ll be hearing from Rudy quite a bit, please.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/trump-campaign-press-conference-transcript-november-4-were-going-to-win-this-election","Trump Campaign Press Conference Transcript November 4: “We’re Going to Win This Election”","timed text issue"
"Rudy Giuliani","Thank you very much, Eric. It is very, very sad that we’re here in the city that’s really the birthplace of our democracy. And this is among one of the most anti-democratic things I’ve ever seen or encountered. And it’s not just here in Philadelphia, this is going on all over the country. We have filed a lawsuit. The lawsuit actually required that when these mail in ballots, that you know are highly suspicious anyway, this form of balloting has always been considered the most prone to fraud.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/trump-campaign-press-conference-transcript-november-4-were-going-to-win-this-election","Trump Campaign Press Conference Transcript November 4: “We’re Going to Win This Election”","timed text issue"

"Rudy Giuliani
Philadelphia, unfortunately, and I say this about my own city, has a reputation for voter fraud. You have a reputation for dead people voting, and we’re going to go look at just how many dead people voted here. I didn’t think we’d have to do that, but we will. And you have a reputation for people being bused in from Camden, voting here.",NA,"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/trump-campaign-press-conference-transcript-november-4-were-going-to-win-this-election","Trump Campaign Press Conference Transcript November 4: “We’re Going to Win This Election”","timed text issue"

"Rudy Giuliani","In Detroit, Michigan. Again, let me be specific what it is, this whole new thing that never happened before in our country, these mail-in ballots, which has been a cause of real concern for everyone because they can easily be fraudulent. Well, one of the things that the law attaches to that is the rights of both parties to observe the ballot. The way we do with absentee ballots. You make certain it’s properly signed on the outside, there’s a signature. You make sure that it’s properly postmarked. You make sure that it’s properly addressed, and then you pass on it. A number of these are often challenged by the Democrat representative or their Republican representative. We never got a chance to look at a single one of them.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/trump-campaign-press-conference-transcript-november-4-were-going-to-win-this-election","Trump Campaign Press Conference Transcript November 4: “We’re Going to Win This Election”","timed text issue"
"Rudy Giuliani","The gentlemen here who did this for us, says about 100,000 ballots went through that process in the 20 plus hours in which they wasted his time by not allowing him to see a single ballot. Well, that’s 120,000 ballots that should just be taken out of the count. So you want to look at that number, that 120,000 should come out. And this is an area in which Biden is getting 60, 70% of the vote. I don’t know if this is going on in any other place, but it is going on with enough frequency in Wisconsin that we’ve brought suit, and now we’ll have to look into three other places. What it says to me is this is a concerted effort of the crooks that run the Democratic party. And you know, these big city machines are crooked. You know that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/trump-campaign-press-conference-transcript-november-4-were-going-to-win-this-election","Trump Campaign Press Conference Transcript November 4: “We’re Going to Win This Election”","timed text issue"
"Rudy Giuliani","20 years, 30 years, 40 years, 50 years, a hundred years of one party rule leads to corruption of all kinds. Voter fraud is one of the biggest, because that’s how you keep your power, but we’re not going to let them get away with it. They’re not going to steal this election. This election gets decided by the people, these people, the elite, they don’t care about the people. The people are the deplorables, the chumps, they’re not important. To President Trump, he’s the whole reason that he ran for office. And he’s the whole reason for which he’s carrying on this campaign, so that your vote can mean something, so that your vote doesn’t get wiped out by 100,000 fraudulent, meaningless paper ballots that no one gets to observe. So we are going to continue the lawsuit here. We’re going to bring a second one and then we’re going to bring a federal lawsuit. And we’re going to take a very good look at whether we bring this nationally. We certainly are going to bring it here, and in Wisconsin. Quite possibly, we’ll do a national lawsuit and really exposed the corruption of the Democratic party.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/trump-campaign-press-conference-transcript-november-4-were-going-to-win-this-election","Trump Campaign Press Conference Transcript November 4: “We’re Going to Win This Election”","timed text issue"
"Rudy Giuliani","But this is beyond anything I’ve ever seen before. This comes when you think you have so much power and you own the media, that you can do anything you want. Well, sorry, we’re going to fight for the people, we’re going to vindicate their right. And the ultimate result is, President Trump has won Pennsylvania. I’ve never heard of a count where you’re ahead by 400,000 with 80 plus percent counted, and they haven’t called it for you yet. They called California the moment the polls closed. How many votes do you have to be ahead to win, for a Republican to win here? How many votes do we have be ahead? 400,000 is not enough with 80 plus percent counted? I think there’s only 14% of the vote to go. Do you think we’re stupid? You think we’re fools?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/trump-campaign-press-conference-transcript-november-4-were-going-to-win-this-election","Trump Campaign Press Conference Transcript November 4: “We’re Going to Win This Election”","timed text issue"
"Rudy Giuliani","You know something? The Democrats do think you’re stupid and they do think you’re fools. And that’s why you get called deplorable and chumps. It’s over. We’re going to stick with this. We’re going to win this election. We’ve actually won it, just a matter of counting the votes fairly. So I’d like to ask the former Attorney General of Florida, Pam Bondi, to explain what’s been going on at the polling places, which is just as dastardly and just as criminal.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/trump-campaign-press-conference-transcript-november-4-were-going-to-win-this-election","Trump Campaign Press Conference Transcript November 4: “We’re Going to Win This Election”","timed text issue"
"Pam Bondi","Thank you Mayor. Good evening everyone. And as Eric Trump said, we are thrilled to have won Pennsylvania with 87% of the vote in, and we’re up almost 400,000 votes. So we’re thrilled. And you ask, well, why do we care about the rest of the votes? Because it is about the integrity of this election. And every vote, as Mayor Giuliani said, in every state, must be counted fairly. What we’ve seen, and we have a video of it that we will release to you. They put up, it looks like a police barricade all the way around the perimeter and they are keeping our poll watchers back, approximately 30 feet, at least 30 feet. You can judge for yourselves. They would not let them look any further. There is a gentleman here by the name of Seth Bluestein, who is an assistant to a city commissioner. And he is wearing a badge the size of a baseball, and as far as I know, he’s not a sworn law enforcement officer. So it looks like intimidation to me, with a police barricade and a man wearing a huge badge around his neck.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/trump-campaign-press-conference-transcript-november-4-were-going-to-win-this-election","Trump Campaign Press Conference Transcript November 4: “We’re Going to Win This Election”","timed text issue"
"Pam Bondi","He told them they can’t come any closer. He said the reason was because of, they can’t interfere with the process, and then something about COVID. Well, we all know at the polls, you have to stay six feet apart. Our poll watchers have no problem with staying six feet away, yet they weren’t allowed to do this. So we’re going to release that video to you because we, oh, and then they also had binoculars. Our poll watchers brought out a pair of binoculars. They were shut down on the binoculars, but then they were told, well, okay, you can use the binoculars. So that’s a concession that we are allowed to observe the ballots. Yet, clearly when you see how big the room is, you cannot see every ballot. You can only see, with the binoculars, the ones that are closest to you. So that’s a concession by them and they’re still not letting us see this. So we need to fix this. We need to remedy this now because we’ve won Pennsylvania and we want every vote to be counted in a fair way. Thank you. And I’d like to introduce Corey Lewandowski.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/trump-campaign-press-conference-transcript-november-4-were-going-to-win-this-election","Trump Campaign Press Conference Transcript November 4: “We’re Going to Win This Election”","timed text issue"
"Corey Lewandowski","General Bondi and I will be here for the remainder until you all realize that President Trump has won this state. We have now officially declared the State of Pennsylvania, Trump country. Until the last vote is counted, General Bondi and I will be here. I’m sure we’ll be in constant communication with you. We will be releasing that video shortly, and we appreciate your time. There’ll be no questions today, thank you very much.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/trump-campaign-press-conference-transcript-november-4-were-going-to-win-this-election","Trump Campaign Press Conference Transcript November 4: “We’re Going to Win This Election”","timed text issue"
"Rudy Giuliani","Jeremy? This is a gentlemen, I’ll have him introduce himself.

"Jeremy Mercer","Hi, thank you, Mayor. Jeremy Mercer and I was at the pre-canvas yesterday from 7:00 AM until just after midnight, back again this morning just before 8:00 AM until around 2:30. And has been described very well we’re there, supposedly observing, but we can’t see. We’re further away than I am from you all here. Hundreds, at least a hundred feet away from open ballots that go back out of our sight. We can’t see them. We don’t know what’s happening to them. It’s just, there’s no way for us to meaningfully observe the process from where they have us.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/trump-campaign-press-conference-transcript-november-4-were-going-to-win-this-election","Trump Campaign Press Conference Transcript November 4: “We’re Going to Win This Election”","timed text issue"

"Jeremy Mercer","Based on the counts that we’ve heard, it’s about 125,000, maybe more.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/trump-campaign-press-conference-transcript-november-4-were-going-to-win-this-election","Trump Campaign Press Conference Transcript November 4: “We’re Going to Win This Election”","timed text issue"
"Rudy Giuliani","Well, so that should be deducted from the count. Those are ballots that were counted in violation of the law, without an observation. And since this is a novel procedure, this mail in thing, observation is particularly important to satisfy the possibility that you can defraud. This isn’t as if you come in and show an identification. So that’s what we’re going to be seeking here and in Wisconsin and quite possibly nationally, if there’s as much evidence in Arizona and Nevada and Michigan.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/trump-campaign-press-conference-transcript-november-4-were-going-to-win-this-election","Trump Campaign Press Conference Transcript November 4: “We’re Going to Win This Election”","timed text issue"
