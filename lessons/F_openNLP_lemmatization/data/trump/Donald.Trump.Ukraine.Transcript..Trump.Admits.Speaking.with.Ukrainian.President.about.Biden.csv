"Donald Trump","Good morning. We have a busy day planned. We’re leaving now for Ellington Air Force Base in Texas. We’re going to spend some time on the floods. We’re going to be briefed on the floods. We’re going to make a big investment so we can try and help Texas with this terrible flooding that they’ve been having. So we’ll be talking to a lot of people and meeting a lot of people. That’s got to be at Ellington Air Force Base. Then we’re going to Houston. Some of you are coming with me, I guess. We’ll be going to Houston, and we’ll be at a very nice big stadium, packed full of people, with Prime Minister Modi of India.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-ukraine-transcript-trump-confirms-speaking-with-ukrainian-president-about-biden","Donald Trump Ukraine Transcript: Trump Admits Speaking with Ukrainian President about Biden","00:01"
"Donald Trump","He asked if I’d go with him, and I’ve accepted. And we’re going to have a good time with Prime Minister Modi. We have a… I hear it’s a tremendous crowd. So that’ll be in Houston. And then after that, I’m going to Ohio. Pratt Industries is opening a $1 billion plant. And I told Mr. Pratt, who is a great… Anthony. I told him if he does something really spectacular, I’ll go and cut the ribbon. And he did. He invested $1 billion in Ohio.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-ukraine-transcript-trump-confirms-speaking-with-ukrainian-president-about-biden","Donald Trump Ukraine Transcript: Trump Admits Speaking with Ukrainian President about Biden","00:37"
"Donald Trump","So that’s Pratt Industries. They’re great people. It’s a great company, headed by a very great businessman from Australia. So they’re bringing $1 billion into Ohio. And I said I’d go and cut the ribbon, and here it is. We’re ready to cut a ribbon. It’s a great plan. So we look forward to that. Then we’re coming home, and then we have a lot of work at the United Nations during the next week.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-ukraine-transcript-trump-confirms-speaking-with-ukrainian-president-about-biden","Donald Trump Ukraine Transcript: Trump Admits Speaking with Ukrainian President about Biden","01:12"

"Donald Trump","Nothing’s ever off the table completely, but I have no intention of meeting with Iran. That doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen. I’m a very flexible person, but we have no intention. It’s not set up. We’re meeting with a lot of leaders. We have about 15 meetings set up, but Iran is not one of them.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-ukraine-transcript-trump-confirms-speaking-with-ukrainian-president-about-biden","Donald Trump Ukraine Transcript: Trump Admits Speaking with Ukrainian President about Biden","01:44"
"Donald Trump","We had a great conversation. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely to the fact that we don’t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in Ukraine, and Ukraine’s got a lot of problems. The new president is saying that he’s going to be able to rid the country of corruption, and I said that would be a great thing. We had a great conversation. We had a conversation on many things. In fact, I believe Ukraine put out a statement yesterday saying that we covered many different topics. It was a warm and friendly conversation.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-ukraine-transcript-trump-confirms-speaking-with-ukrainian-president-about-biden","Donald Trump Ukraine Transcript: Trump Admits Speaking with Ukrainian President about Biden","02:09"
"Donald Trump","I’ve backed Ukraine from the beginning, but I’m very upset that other countries aren’t doing the same. Germany should be spending much more. France, all of the European Union, should be spending money. Why are we spending money and they’re not? Or at least they spending very little by comparison, so I’m not happy about that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-ukraine-transcript-trump-confirms-speaking-with-ukrainian-president-about-biden","Donald Trump Ukraine Transcript: Trump Admits Speaking with Ukrainian President about Biden","02:59"

"Donald Trump","Oh, I would have no problem with it. Rudy’s a very straight shooter, and Rudy wants to see the same thing as a lot of other people with respect to Ukraine. Ukraine has had a tremendous corruption problem. Somehow they were involved in a lot of different things that took place in our country, and hopefully it can be straightened out. And I will say, the new president… We had a very good talk. The new president got elected based on the fact that he would end corruption. That was probably his number one thing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-ukraine-transcript-trump-confirms-speaking-with-ukrainian-president-about-biden","Donald Trump Ukraine Transcript: Trump Admits Speaking with Ukrainian President about Biden","03:26"
"Donald Trump","Well, this whistleblower, or whoever it was, because it sounds like it’s not a whistleblower, you can’t have that happen to a president of the United States. The conversation by the way, was absolutely perfect. It was a beautiful, warm, nice conversation, and it was put out last night also by Ukraine. But you can’t have people doing this, and you can’t have people doing false alarms like this. And you know, when the president speaks to the head of another country, he has to be able to speak to those people, and those people don’t want to know that they’re being recorded or that you have a stenographer working.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-ukraine-transcript-trump-confirms-speaking-with-ukrainian-president-about-biden","Donald Trump Ukraine Transcript: Trump Admits Speaking with Ukrainian President about Biden","04:00"
"Donald Trump","You don’t want to have to hear that. You can’t do that to a president, and you can’t do that to other countries. But with all of that being said, we had a very great conversation, very straight, very honest conversation. I hope they can put it out.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-ukraine-transcript-trump-confirms-speaking-with-ukrainian-president-about-biden","Donald Trump Ukraine Transcript: Trump Admits Speaking with Ukrainian President about Biden","04:36"
"Donald Trump","Well, I don’t say anything, but whenever I speak to a foreign leader, I assume there are many people on the line. I don’t assume I’m talking to the leader. Anytime I’m on the phone with a foreign leader, many many people are on the line. Sometimes they’re taping calls, sometimes they’re doing a stenographer, but I also assume many people are on the line from the other side. So if I’m speaking to a country, they also have people on the line. So who would say a thing like what you’re saying? Now I will say this. I said absolutely nothing wrong. It was perfect. Listen to me. Listen. Listen to me.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-ukraine-transcript-trump-confirms-speaking-with-ukrainian-president-about-biden","Donald Trump Ukraine Transcript: Trump Admits Speaking with Ukrainian President about Biden","04:55"

"Donald Trump","Listen to me. I assume many people are on the line. I know that before I make the call, and that’s what you have… Intelligence agencies, everybody listening. That call was a great call. It was a perfect call. A perfect call. What wasn’t perfect is the horrible thing that Joe Biden said. And now we made a lie when he said he never spoke to his son. I mean, give me a break. He’s already said he spoke to his son, and now he said yesterday very firmly, “Who wouldn’t speak to your son? Of course you spoke to your son.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-ukraine-transcript-trump-confirms-speaking-with-ukrainian-president-about-biden","Donald Trump Ukraine Transcript: Trump Admits Speaking with Ukrainian President about Biden","05:34"
"Donald Trump","So he made the mistake of saying he never spoke to his son. He spoke to his son, but more importantly, what he said about the billions of dollars that he wouldn’t give them unless they fired the prosecutor, and then he bragged about how they fired the prosecutor, and then they got the money.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-ukraine-transcript-trump-confirms-speaking-with-ukrainian-president-about-biden","Donald Trump Ukraine Transcript: Trump Admits Speaking with Ukrainian President about Biden","06:09"

"Donald Trump","Well, not only Ukraine. Take a look at China. They took a tremendous amount of money out of China. Now, if they ever took over a China negotiation, he would sell us out. Look at all the money he made in China. The son, he knew nothing. The son is a stiff. He knew nothing, and he’s making hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars, and he did the same thing in Ukraine. He knows nothing. This is a very dishonest thing that Joe Biden did, and then he said he never spoke to his son. Does anybody believe that one?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-ukraine-transcript-trump-confirms-speaking-with-ukrainian-president-about-biden","Donald Trump Ukraine Transcript: Trump Admits Speaking with Ukrainian President about Biden","07:07"
"Donald Trump","But then he also said long before that he did speak to his son. So he lied again. But what he said is that he wouldn’t give, I think it was billions of dollars to Ukraine, unless they fired the prosecutor who was looking at his son and his son’s company, the company that his son works with. And that’s a very dishonest thing. And I’m not looking to hurt Biden. I’m not even looking to hold him to it, to be honest, but he said a very bad thing. He said a very foolish thing. Now me, on the other hand, my conversation with the president, the new president of Ukraine, was perfect.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-ukraine-transcript-trump-confirms-speaking-with-ukrainian-president-about-biden","Donald Trump Ukraine Transcript: Trump Admits Speaking with Ukrainian President about Biden","07:37"
