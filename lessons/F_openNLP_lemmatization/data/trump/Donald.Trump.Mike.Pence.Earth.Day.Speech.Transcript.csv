One of the most important ways we uphold this tradition is by protecting our priceless national parks and our public lands.

As a sign of our dedication in a few moments, the First Lady and I will plant a maple tree right here on the South Lawn of the White House wherever the tree is. Where is this tree now? That’s a beautiful straight trunk. That’s a triple A tree. That’s great. As our nation grows stronger and greater in the months and years to come and we will. We will be bigger, better, stronger than ever before. You watch what’s happening. You see it happening already. There’s such spirit with the concept of the state starting to open. Such incredible spirit. This tree will grow also. It will stand tall and beautiful and the future generations will be looking at it and they’ll say, “I wonder who planted that tree.” They will say it was Kevin and David and Mike and Karen and a whole group of people. We really appreciate it.

I know we are here in the midst of National Park Week, just a few days before Arbor Day on the 50th anniversary of Earth Day to plant and commemorate this beautiful maple tree. But as you said, Mr. President, we also gather at a time of great challenge in the life of our nation, but it’s a time the American people have met the challenge. As you’ve observed, Mr. President, that with your leadership, the American people are beginning to step forward. The states around the country beginning to put into practice the guidelines to open up America again. You’re a president who knows that America works when America is working.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-earth-day-speech-transcript","Donald Trump Mike Pence Earth Day Speech Transcript","04:59"

I know the American people are anxious to see us on this Earth Day 2020, a few days from Arbor Day. They’re anxious to get back to enjoying all of those beautiful parks and will greatly welcome your direction.

"Kevin McCarthy","This is the first of 1 trillion trees that will be planted around the world. Trees are the lungs of the earth. They inhale carbon dioxide and they exhale oxygen. When 1 trillion trees are planted around this earth, that will remove the equivalent of two-thirds of all manmade carbon dioxide of all carbon since the Industrial Revolution until today.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-earth-day-speech-transcript","Donald Trump Mike Pence Earth Day Speech Transcript","08:31"

"Donald Trump","Thank you, Kevin. It was beautiful. Thank you. He gave a lot of facts that a lot of people didn’t know, including me. I thought that… I just spoke with our great First Lady and she said, “You know, it’d be wonderful for Karen Pence to say a few words.” People have no idea the incredible job Karen Pence does representing this nation. Everybody loves her. She’s special in every way. Karen, I’d like to have you say a few words please.

"Karen Pence","Thank you, Mr. President. I do cherish the opportunity to speak because David and I were just talking about while this tree makes the earth better and stronger, we talked a lot about mental health. That’s an issue that I know the First Lady has been dealing with her whole time that she’s been First Lady, but I just started doing a little bit with Prevents. We do want people to understand that during this crisis, we need to also mitigate the effects on our mental health. So we ask people to watch out for yourself, check in with yourself every day, check in with those you love. If there’s something that you like to do. For me it’s painting, maybe it’s gardening, maybe it’s reading or cooking. We ask people to schedule that into your day so that you have a little bit of time that’s just for you each day.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-earth-day-speech-transcript","Donald Trump Mike Pence Earth Day Speech Transcript","10:01"
"Karen Pence","Then we also ask that you talk about the struggles, but also talk about the successes. As you have kids who are struggling with not having their graduation ceremony or they’re not being able to go out and play sports or they’re missing their friends or their teachers, it’s important to talk with them and let them get those issues out. But also talk about the successes, some of the great things that are happening while we’re having to stay at home, things you’re learning about your family, games you’re starting to play that maybe you didn’t play before.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-earth-day-speech-transcript","Donald Trump Mike Pence Earth Day Speech Transcript","10:58"
