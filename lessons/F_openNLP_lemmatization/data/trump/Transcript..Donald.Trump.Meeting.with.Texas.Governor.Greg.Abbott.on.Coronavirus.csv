"Peter Alexander","…tested positive for COVID-19, got so close to you?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","00:00"
"Donald Trump","Well, I think probably that has to do with the fact that we all believe in tests. We have the best tests in the world, but they were tested. I believe they’re tested on a weekly basis. I just had a test, as you probably heard. In fact, I had one yesterday and I had one today and it’s negative. Mike just had a test and it’s negative, but they do the tests and it just shows you that the fallacy, it’s what I’ve been saying. Testing is not a perfect art. No matter what you do, testing is not a perfect art. So we test once a week. Now we’re going to go testing once a day. But even when you test once a day, somebody could, something happens where they catch something. I’ve had very little contact, personal contact with this gentlemen, know who he is, good person, but I’ve had very little contact. Mike has had very little contact with him, but Mike was tested and I was tested. We were both tested.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","00:04"
"Donald Trump","Yeah it’s a little bit strange, but it’s one of those things. It’s as I said, I said yesterday, Governor, all people are warriors in this country. Right now we’re all warriors. You’re warriors, we’re warriors. You could be with somebody, everything’s fine and then something happens to that person and all of a sudden test positive and we’re all warriors together. I am. You are. We all are. It’s what we were saying before. It shows the testing and we have the best tests in the world, but what happens in between when you got tested and just a couple of days later, so in this case there were a number of days missed and it was a long weekend and things and so you never know. But we both tested in a negative fashion, I guess you would call it. Any other questions?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","01:03"
"Speaker 1","Mr. President, could we get your reaction to some breaking news? The Justice Department has decided to dismiss the case against Michael Flynn. Are you aware of that?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","01:53"
"Donald Trump","I didn’t know that was happening at this moment. I felt it was going to happen just by watching and seeing like everybody else does. He was an innocent man. He is a great gentlemen. He was targeted by the Obama administration and he was targeted in order to try and take down a President. And what they’ve done is a disgrace. And I hope a big price is going to be paid. A big price should be paid. It’s never been anything like this in the history of our country. What they did, what the Obama administration did is unprecedented, has never happened. Never happened, a thing like this has never happened before in the history of our country. And I hope a lot of people are going to pay a big price because they’re dishonest, crooked people. They’re scum. And I say it a lot.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","02:00"
"Donald Trump","They’re scum. They’re human scum. They should never have happened in this country. A duly elected President. And they went after him by going after fine people. And those fine people said, no, I’m not going to lie. I can’t lie. He’s not the only one. There are many of them. And they all said, I can’t lie. They could have said something like, oh, make up a lie. Trump loves somebody or something, or some country. And they said, oh, you wouldn’t have any problem. That’s what they were trying to do and it’s a disgrace. The Obama administration, Justice Department was a disgrace and they got caught. They got caught. Very dishonest people, but much more than dishonest, it’s treason. It’s treason. So I’m very happy for General Flynn. He was a great warrior and he still is a great warrior. Now in my book, he’s an even greater warrior.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","02:49"
"Donald Trump","What happened to him should never happen again. And what happened to this presidency, to go through all of that and still do more than any President has ever done in the first three years is pretty amazing when you think of it with what we’ve done with regulations and tax cuts and second amendment and all of the things we’ve done. It’s never happened. And until two months ago, we had the greatest economy in history. Unfortunately, we had, like you did in Texas, we had to close it down. But for these people to have done that, I am very proud of General Flynn. I can tell you that right now.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","03:46"
"Speaker 1","Who would you like to see pay a price for this?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","04:21"
"Donald Trump","Oh, the people should pay a big price for what they’ve done to this country. They should pay a big price. And their partner, very complicit, is a thing called the media. The media is totally guilty, and all of those writers and so-called journalists, they’re not journalists, they’re thieves. All of those journalists that received a Pulitzer Prize should be forced to give those Pulitzer Prizes back because they were all wrong. There was no, because if you saw today more documents came out saying there was absolutely no collusion with Russia, came out very loud and clear and they wrote for years because they tried to do a number on the presidency and this President, happened to be me.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","04:24"
"Donald Trump","Pulitzer Prizes should all be returned because you know what, they were giving out falsely. It was fake news. They’re all fake news. Those Pulitzer Prizes should be given back immediately and the Pulitzer committee or whoever gives the prizes, they’re a disgrace unless they take those prizes back because they got Pulitzer Prizes for what turned out to be false stories. And Pulitzer Prizes should be given to the ones that got it right. And I could give you a long list of those names too. And you know who I’m talking about.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","05:11"

"Donald Trump","Yes, we are helping various countries. As you know, Russia’s having a hard time with the same COVID-19. They got hit like everybody else got hit and we had a long talk and also the 75th year. And you know what the 75th year means, it was very nice. He called me because we were partners so to speak, for a very big successful war. And it was very nice. He called to, as a congratulatory call, as a call of celebration because it was the 75th year. And also I suggested if they need, because we have a lot of ventilators, if they need ventilators, we’d love to send them some and we will do that at the appropriate time. We’ll send them some ventilators. Yeah, we’ll be doing that. And that was a very nice call. And remember this, the Russia hoax made it very hard for Russia and the United States to deal with each other.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","05:52"
"Donald Trump","They are a very important nation, we’re the most powerful nation. They’re a very powerful nation. Why would we not be dealing with each other? But the Russia hoax is absolute dishonest hoax, made it very difficult for our nation and their nation to deal and we discussed that. I said it’s a very appropriate time because things are falling out now and coming in line showing what a hoax this whole investigation was. It was a total disgrace and I wouldn’t be surprised if you see a lot of things happen over the next number of weeks. This is just one piece of a very dishonest puzzle.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","06:50"

Is that getting anywhere?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","07:29"
"Donald Trump","We are talking about arms control with Russia and we will go forward with that and we are talking about it very seriously, having arms control. They have many nuclear weapons and so do we. We’re talking about an arms control with Russia. Yeah, they’d like to do it. We’d like to do it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","07:35"
"Peter Alexander","Sir, can I ask you about the economy today? We’ve learned that 33 million jobs have been lost in the last seven weeks. Will there be more jobs lost in May or is that number going to start coming down next month?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","07:52"
"Donald Trump","Well, yeah, Peter, the number will start coming down at an appropriate time. Whatever that is. I’m viewing the third quarter as being a very important quarter because that’s, as I said, that’ll be a transition. I think you could almost say a transition into greatness because I think next year we’re going to have a phenomenal year, a phenomenal year economically, and we’re working very hard now. The Governor’s working along with us, the relationship with Texas has been phenomenal. And Texas is opening up and a lot of places are opening up and we want to do it. And I’m not sure that we even have a choice. I think we have to do it. This country can’t stay closed and locked down for years. Somebody could say, let’s keep it closed for a couple of years. United States of America, the greatest economy in history, two months ago in the history of our country, in the history of the world, we had a far greater economy than anybody, including China by a lot. And we had to close it down in order to really.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","08:01"
"Donald Trump","And we had to close it down in order to really do something about the plague, but we did something and we did a lot, and we also, you know what, governor? We learned a lot about it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","09:03"
"Governor Greg Abbott","We did.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","09:12"
"Donald Trump","We know that you may have fires every once in a while in certain locations, some little ones, maybe some big ones, but you know how to shut it down. You might speak about that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","09:12"
"Governor Greg Abbott","Sure, I would. I was talking with Dr. Birx about that. And so what we’ve done, we’ve been able to contain the spread of the coronavirus in Texas, but at the same time, we created these surge forces that will go out to regions where there are flare ups, and it’s like putting out a fire out. We have a surge force working in the panhandle in Texas right now up in Amarillo and just North of Amarillo because of an outbreak at a meat packing plant.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","09:20"
"Governor Greg Abbott","And there are several other issues with other meat packing plants in Texas. Basically, there’s only three categories causing any type of outbreak. There are meatpacking plants, there are jails and there are senior centers. And so we have task forces that focus on those three areas. If it weren’t for those three categories, the people in Texas testing positive would be very minimal.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","09:47"
"Donald Trump","And the governor and I have spoken about what he’s doing with senior citizen centers is incredible. The time and effort and love that you’re giving to senior citizens, they were just what has gone on throughout the country in some instances as you know, senior citizens areas. And the governor’s really made that a point, really almost before anybody I can think of.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","10:10"
"Governor Greg Abbott","Because of that, we have one of the lowest death rates in the United States of America.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","10:34"
"Speaker 4","Lastly, about Texas. Police were used with an armored vehicle and guns drawn to shut down a bar that’s opened up in going against the order. What role does police have in enforcing these kind of lock down and social dispensing orders?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","10:42"
"Governor Greg Abbott","Well there’s different standards used in different communities, however, today I made one thing clear. And that is, as we go through this process of trying to maintain the order in our States, as we are asking the people in our state to comply with these orders, we should not be taking these people and put them behind bars. These people who have spent their life building up a business and being told to shut it down and lose every penny they have. And then if they don’t follow every little fine point of all the rules, they suddenly are subject to arrest, that is wrong. And that’s why I issued another executive order today saying that, in the state of Texas, no one could be put behind bars because they’re not following an executive order. It’s common sense.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","10:56"

Are you contact tracing the people around this area that would have had contact with this person? Is there a 14 day quarantining, or should there be for those who are in touch with-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","11:51"
"Donald Trump","They’re doing everything that you can do, again, within the limits of testing, and you know what that is. We have the ultimate testing, we have the best tests in the world and we gave more than anybody else. And I’ve always said, testing is somewhat overrated because what happens after somebody takes a test, what’s going on there? And Mike was just saying the word essential, essential workers. And as you know, essential workers are immune from the… Mike, do you want to maybe mention that?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","12:03"
"Mike Pence","Well, from the CDC guidance, been very clear that from the beginning of this outbreak, for anyone that comes into contact with someone with Coronavirus, we, early on recommended that people self quarantine. That recommendation, of course, was before we had done at this point, some 7.7 million tests around the country in states like Texas, are distributing tests very quickly to people that, either have symptoms or are suspected to possibly have contracted the Coronavirus.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","12:32"
"Mike Pence","But with regard to essential workers, the president referred to, we’ve always had an exception. People to keep food on the table, people that are involved in public safety, most especially healthcare workers. We’ve asked them to continue to go to work by taking other counter measures and including testing to ensure that they’ve not contracted the disease. And as the president indicated, the White House now has initiated an effort that the president and I not only will be tested every day, but I think everyone that comes into contact with the president will be tested every day. And so, keeping the essential work here at the White House moving forward in our national response is the priority going forward.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","13:02"

"Dr. Birx","Yeah, no, we had a long discussion. We had a particular discussion and I think many people know, I don’t understand the nail salon piece because I’ve never had my nails done, so I couldn’t understand…","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","14:00"

"Dr. Birx","It’s true. So I didn’t really understand it. So we talked about not having them in the first opening wave because you can’t really physical distance. And we had that discussion and he agreed and we’ve moved forward together, and I think it’s those kinds of dialogues. And I think what’s really been impressive to me by the governors is how much they know about epidemiology. So they will never be confused in another pandemic, ever again. Because he came with all of his data about, “What county had what. That was a prison, that was…” And believe me, I had all my data with me and he was able to answer every county and what the issue was.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","14:11"
"Dr. Birx","And I think when you look at Houston, when you look at Dallas and you see the ability to really contain and mitigate those epidemics, but the same time contain epidemics and not allow them to spread in the community, this is what we’ve been asking governors to do with the test and using focus testing to really find asymptomatic cases and protect the vulnerable. And the ability to go into prison, to go into meat packing plants, and go into the senior care centers and proactively test is really quite extraordinary. And I think we still remain concerned about asymptomatic spread. And we think that the progress that they’re making on testing in a focused way to protect others is really a way that we can move forward together to protect everyone in the community.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","14:48"

So I don’t want to get in a comparison with the governors because I’ve talked to some incredible governors who are all doing quite a good job.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","15:35"

"Speaker 6","Dr. Birx, a followup, or perhaps Mr. President. 20 States by the account of multiple organizations right now that haven’t met the guidelines that you set here have, either partially or completely reopened. What do you say to those states that haven’t met the guidelines that are already starting that process now?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","15:48"
"Donald Trump","We’ve looked at all of them, we’ve spoken to many of the governors, most of the governors. As you know, we give leeway to the governors, and these are governors that have done a good job in, I think all cases. I have some that I don’t think are doing a particularly good job, but for the most part they have and these governors have. And we give them the leeway, they have to do what they’re doing, like governor Abbott. When you look at the job he’s done at Texas, I rely on his judgment. And you have parts of Texas, vast parts of Texas where there’s no problem whatsoever. I mean, there’s literally nothing and it would be a shame to keep that closed.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","16:02"

We’re doing a lot of things all over the world, militarily. We’ve been taken advantage of all over the world, our military, and in the sense that we’re, and this has nothing to do with Saudi Arabia, this has to do with other countries, frankly, much more. We have the most powerful military in the world. We’ve spent $1.5 trillion since I’ve been here, more than that. $1.5 trillion on-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","17:35"
"Donald Trump","Ever since I’ve been here, more than that, $1.5 trillion on a military that we now have the strongest military we’ve ever had. We have the best equipment, the best missiles, planes, the best of everything. We’re authorizing and just authorized ships, new ships being built. They’re all being built in the United States and they’re beauties. We have the best submarines in the world by far and we have submarines being built and we go around and protect other countries and other countries don’t respect us like they should. In some cases, they don’t even like us. And those days are over, those days are over. So things are moving. And I’m not putting Saudi on that thing, but we are doing certain things that will be positive for us and I think very positive for them, too.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","18:03"
"Donald Trump","Saudi Arabia is a very wealthy country and they’ve agreed to help defray some of the costs, which nobody else would ever ask for of course, you probably have to have a good business person in charge of a country. I don’t want to sound overly anything. I just want to tell you that very wealthy countries, we were protecting for nothing, for nothing or very little. South Korea has agreed to pay substantial money to us, which we appreciate very much. And we ask countries to help us. We’re spending $1.5 trillion, we’re spending all of this money. It costs us a lot of money. Our military budget’s three times more and even four times more than the second largest spender of money. It’s more than that. Four times more plus and if we’re going to defend countries, they should also respect us by making a contribution.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-meeting-with-texas-governor-greg-abbott-on-coronavirus","Transcript: Donald Trump Meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Coronavirus","18:49"

"Donald Trump","Yeah, I don’t want to talk about that, yet, but we have pulled a lot of troops out of different places. We were guarding the border between Turkey and Syria for years and we had thousands of people there. And I said, “Wait a minute, let me ask you this. Turkey, Syria, two big countries. They know how to guard their border. They’d been fighting with each other for years. Why do we have thousands of soldiers?” Ultimately, we got it down to 57 soldiers and then 27 soldiers and then they were getting a little hostile toward each other. I say, “Get my 27 soldiers out.” And that was about a year ago and I took a lot of heat. People said, “Oh, that’s terrible.” I said, “No, it’s not terrible.” Nothing’s happened on the border. They’ve been fighting each other for a thousand years under different names, probably a lot longer than a thousand years. I said, “I don’t want my troops there.” So we’re essentially out of Syria other than we kept the oil. We kept the oil. Of course, that was better two months ago than it is now. Keeping the oil today is not as good as it would have been two months ago. Two months ago, it was a wise thing.

"Donald Trump","Well, I think you have to have something having to do with liability for COVID because you can’t have a restaurant and a guy is going to open and it’s a nice business, but it’s not exactly the oil business in its prime. And somebody leaves and they say, “Oh, I’m going to sue them because they caught the plague.” And now whether he was guilty or not, the legal fees would drive him out of business. You can’t do that. I think you’re going to probably have to have something. I would support that. You go to a game and you sue the team owner or you go to someplace and it would be litigation heaven and you’ll never know where they caught it. You never know where they catch it. So we have to have something like that otherwise there’s going to be lawsuits.

I think I’m very well versed when it comes to not only the pandemic, but everything. I enjoy that and I think I have an obligation to do it. But there’s certainly a more honorable source than some. Some is fake. If you look at CNN, it’s fake news. If you look at MSDNC, I call it MSDNC, you know what that means right? Democratic National Committee. You look at NBC. NBC to me is very dishonest news and that’s why they fired Andy Lack, I guess. You’ll have to ask them, but Andy Lack was a hack and they fired him and they did a big favor to the world and to this country. But no, I find NBC to be very dishonest, I find, which is a Comcast division. I call it Concast with an N. I don’t use the M. I always call it Concast. ABC I thought he gave me a very fair interview the other night. Very good professional. I’ve had very good relationships with him, as you know.

Where they got a lot of people to try and pretend like it was a mass amount of chaos and disorder. You saw that, it was terrible.
