"Jonathan Swan","We appreciate you taking the time, and we appreciate your commitment to answer our questions.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-axios-on-hbo","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Jonathan Swan of Axios on HBO","01:11"
"President Donald J. Trump","Sure.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-axios-on-hbo","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Jonathan Swan of Axios on HBO","01:16"
"Jonathan Swan","We really appreciate that. Over the years, I’ve heard you talk about your adherence to a philosophy called positive thinking. Is this the mantra that if you believe something, if you visualize it, then it will happen?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-axios-on-hbo","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Jonathan Swan of Axios on HBO","01:16"
"President Donald J. Trump","To an extent. I also think in terms of the downside. I do. I’ve been given a lot of credit for positive thinking, but I also think about downside because only a fool doesn’t.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-axios-on-hbo","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Jonathan Swan of Axios on HBO","01:29"
"Jonathan Swan","To what extent do you think that that positive thinking mindset is suitable to handling the worst pandemic that we’ve seen in a century?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-axios-on-hbo","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Jonathan Swan of Axios on HBO","01:40"
"President Donald J. Trump","I think you have to have a positive outlook. Otherwise, you would have nothing without a positive outlook. I think we’ve done an incredible job, between the ventilators and stopping very infected people from China coming in, meaning putting the ban on China, which frankly nobody wanted me to do, practically nobody because it was very early in January. Then putting the ban on Europe, not an easy thing to do. When you put a ban on Europe, that’s a big thing. We would have probably lost hundreds of thousands of lives more had I not done that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-axios-on-hbo","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Jonathan Swan of Axios on HBO","01:49"
"President Donald J. Trump","And all of the experts, every one of them, not one of them wanted to do it. They thought it was too severe. Three months later, they’re all saying, I’m glad you did it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-axios-on-hbo","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Jonathan Swan of Axios on HBO","02:18"
"Jonathan Swan","The criticism of you that is most prominent, is about the communication. It’s the public health experts saying that it needs to be based in reality. And they’re saying that the wishful thinking and the salesmanship is just not suitable in a time when the pandemic has killed 145,000 Americans. And I understand what you’re saying, that people need to hear positive thinking, but for the past five months it’s been, the virus is totally under control, and the cases have been going up and the deaths have been going up.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-axios-on-hbo","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Jonathan Swan of Axios on HBO","02:27"
"President Donald J. Trump","Look, look.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-axios-on-hbo","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Jonathan Swan of Axios on HBO","02:59"
"Jonathan Swan","But you’ve been saying it’s under control.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-axios-on-hbo","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Jonathan Swan of Axios on HBO","03:00"
"President Donald J. Trump","Nobody knew what this thing was all about. This has never happened before. 1917, but it was a totally different, it was a flu in that case. Okay? But other than 1917, there’s never been anything like this. And by the way, if you watch the fake news on television, they don’t even talk about it. But you know, there are 188 of the countries right now that are suffering, some proportionately far greater than we are. Okay? As bad as we are.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-axios-on-hbo","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Jonathan Swan of Axios on HBO","03:01"

"President Donald J. Trump","Some proportionately greater than we are. Right now, right now, Spain is having a big spike. There are tremendous problems in the world. You look at Moscow, look at what’s going on with Moscow. Look at Brazil, look at these countries what’s going on. This was sent to us by China, one way or the other, and we’re never going to forget it. Believe me, we’re never going to forget it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-axios-on-hbo","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Jonathan Swan of Axios on HBO","03:24"
"President Donald J. Trump","And we were beating China at every single point. We were beating them on trade, we were making progress like nobody’s ever made progress. Before the pandemic, they had the worst year, Jonathan, that they’ve had in 67 years. You know that. With the tariffs and everything else I did, we would taking in billions of dollars. I was giving some of it to the farmers. The farmers were doing well because they were targeting the farmers, I was targeting China. We were doing good.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-axios-on-hbo","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Jonathan Swan of Axios on HBO","03:46"
"President Donald J. Trump","Then all of a sudden, the game changed, and I had to close it down. I closed down the greatest economy ever in history.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-axios-on-hbo","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Jonathan Swan of Axios on HBO","04:14"

"President Donald J. Trump","Well, wait. And then, I closed it down. And now we’re opening it. And we saved, by the way, by closing it down, we saved millions of lives. If we would have gone to herd and we knew very little about the disease, if we would’ve gone herd, we would have lost millions of people, millions of people. One person’s too much. We’re at 140,000 people. One person is too much. We’re at 140. We would have lost millions of people. And those people that really understand it, they really understand it. They said, it’s incredible the job that we’ve done. And again, I bring it up, the ban-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-axios-on-hbo","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Jonathan Swan of Axios on HBO","04:21"

"Jonathan Swan","It was already here. By the time you banned China, it came in through Europe.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-axios-on-hbo","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Jonathan Swan of Axios on HBO","05:05"

"Jonathan Swan","But the question is, Mr. President, by June we knew things were bad. And the last time I was with you was the day before your Tulsa rally in the Oval, and you were saying big, huge crowd, it was endorsed. These people, they listen to you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-axios-on-hbo","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Jonathan Swan of Axios on HBO","05:12"
"President Donald J. Trump","By the way, [crosstalk 00:05:30] Excuse me, Jonathan, we had a 19,000 seat stadium and first of all, we had 12,000 people, not 6,000, which you reported and other people reported. But you couldn’t even get in. It was like an armed camp.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-axios-on-hbo","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Jonathan Swan of Axios on HBO","05:30"
"Jonathan Swan","Why would you want it that?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-axios-on-hbo","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Jonathan Swan of Axios on HBO","05:40"
"President Donald J. Trump","Because they had 120 Black Lives Matter people there and Tulsa-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-axios-on-hbo","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Jonathan Swan of Axios on HBO","05:41"

"President Donald J. Trump","Excuse me, wait. And Tulsa, well, because that area was a very good area at the time. It was an area that was pretty much over. [crosstalk 00:05:55] After, after, a month later, it started going up. That’s a month later, but Tulsa was a very good, Oklahoma was doing very well as a state. It was almost free. It spiked a month later, a month and a half, two months later. But it was a good area.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-axios-on-hbo","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Jonathan Swan of Axios on HBO","05:45"
"President Donald J. Trump","We had a tremendous crowd, we had tremendous response. It was like an armed camp. You couldn’t even get through. You couldn’t get anybody in. But we had 12,000 people. It was incorrectly reported. The other thing we had that nobody wants to talk about, so Fox broadcast it. It was the highest rating in the history of Fox television Saturday night. It was the highest rating.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-axios-on-hbo","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Jonathan Swan of Axios on HBO","06:09"

And nobody says that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-axios-on-hbo","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Jonathan Swan of Axios on HBO","06:34"
"Jonathan Swan","I think you misunderstand me. I’m not criticizing your ability to draw a crowd. Are you kidding me? I’ve covered you for five years. You draw massive crowds. You get huge ratings. I’m asking about the public health","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-axios-on-hbo","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Jonathan Swan of Axios on HBO","06:44"
"President Donald J. Trump","I’m just saying this. I’m just saying this. At the time… And I canceled another one. I had to cancel it and we were going to have a great crowd in New Hampshire, and I canceled it for the same reason.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-axios-on-hbo","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Jonathan Swan of Axios on HBO","06:52"
"Jonathan Swan","But here’s the question. I’ve covered you for a long time. I’ve gone to your rallies. I’ve talked to your people. They love you. They listen to you. They listen to every word you say, they hang on your every word. They don’t listen to me or the media or Fauci. They think we’re fake news. They want to get their advice from you. And so, when they hear you say, everything’s under control, don’t worry about wearing masks.

"President Donald J. Trump","They are dying. That’s true. And it is what it is. But that doesn’t mean we aren’t doing everything we can. It’s under control as much as you can control it.

"President Donald J. Trump","Well, I’ll tell you, I’d like to know if somebody… First of all, we have done a great job. We’ve gotten the governors everything they needed, they didn’t do their job. Many of them didn’t and some of them did. Someday we’ll sit down. We’ll talk about the successful ones, the good ones. Look at that smile. The good ones and the bad. We had good and bad. And we had a lot in the middle, but we had some incredible governors. I could tell you right now who the great ones are and who the not so great ones are, but the governors do it. We gave them massive amounts of material.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-axios-on-hbo","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Jonathan Swan of Axios on HBO","07:43"
"Jonathan Swan","Mr. President, you changed your message this week, in terms of you canceled the Jacksonville convention, you said, “Wear a mask.” You’re saying that, “It’s going to get worse before it gets better.” It’s not something you’d like to say, I know. And you said that.

"Jonathan Swan","If I could just finish my question. The question is, even some of your own aides wonder whether you would stick to that message until Election Day, whether in a week or two, you won’t say, “Right, we’ve got to reopen again. We can’t do this stuff anymore.” That you’ll get bored of talking about the virus and go back to that sort of cheerleading.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-axios-on-hbo","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Jonathan Swan of Axios on HBO","08:31"
