Mr. President, thank you for joining us.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","00:26"

"George Stephanopoulos","We’re here with a group of Pennsylvania voters. As you can see, we’re socially distanced in this COVID era.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","00:31"
"Donald Trump","I can see, definitely. There’s no doubt about it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","00:34"
"George Stephanopoulos","Everyone’s been tested. You should know that some of these people voted for you last time around, some voted for Hillary Clinton, some voted for third party candidates or no one at all. All have written their own questions. The first one comes from Paul Tubiana. Paul, take it away.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","00:36"
"Donald Trump","Hi, Paul.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","00:52"
"Paul Tubiana","Mr. President, I voted for you in 2016. I’m conservative pro-life and diabetic. I’ve had to dodge people who don’t care about social distancing and wearing face masks. I thought you were doing a good job with a pandemic response until about May 1st. Then you took your foot off the gas pedal. Why did you throw vulnerable people like me under the bus?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","00:56"
"Donald Trump","Well, we really didn’t, Paul. We’ve worked very hard on the pandemic. We’ve worked very hard. It came off from China. They should have never let it happen. If you look at what we’ve done with ventilators and now, frankly, with vaccines, we’re very close to having a good vaccine. If you want to know the truth, the previous administration would have taken perhaps years to have a vaccine because of the FDA and all the approvals. And we’re within weeks of getting it, could be three weeks, four weeks, but we think we have a Johnson & Johnson Pfizer. We have great companies and they’re very, very close. It’s a terrible thing. But if you look at as an example, are you from New York? Where are you from?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","01:22"
"Paul Tubiana","Originally, I’m from New York. I’ve lived in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania for 18 and a half years. It’s the longest place I’ve ever lived.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","02:05"
"Donald Trump","Well, that’s very good. It’s a good place. But actually, if you look at what we’ve done for various things, we built hospitals. New York, we took the Convention Center, converted it to 2,800 rooms. We brought in the ships. I wish they would have used it because frankly they would have saved a lot of people had they used it, but we really are. We’re starting to get very good marks. If you look at what we’ve done compared to other countries with the excess mortality, the excess mortality rate, we’ve done very, very well.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","02:12"
"Donald Trump","When you see our testing, we’re going to be at 84 million tests, 84 million. Think of that. And next would be India with about 50 million less. Our testing program’s far greater. I brought this along today because I think it’s something that’s really very special. We have a new test that came out literally today, that’s just showing you a numbers of how well we’re doing relative to other countries.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","02:40"
"Donald Trump","But this is actually a new test just came out from Abbott, highly sophisticated. You wouldn’t think it’s a piece of a really little light cardboard. This came out and this is a very accurate test and people will be able to have this and they’ll be able to test or ideally go through a doctor. But it’s very simple and very accurate.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","03:05"
"Donald Trump","We supplied governors including this state with equipment like nobody’s ever gotten. We were short on ventilators because the cupboards were bare when we took it over. We’re now making thousands of ventilators a month, many thousands that we’re sending, and we don’t need them in our country anymore. Not one person that needed a ventilator, didn’t get a ventilator. Everybody got a ventilator and, Paul, they’re very complex. They’re very hard to make, but we’re making out tens of thousands a month and sending them to other countries who are in dire need of them.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","03:27"
"Donald Trump","I feel that we’ve done a tremendous job, actually and it’s something that I don’t think it’s been recognized like it should. But when you look at our testing, when you look at our swabs, when you look at our ventilators, when you look at what we’ve done with hospitals, and we’ve made a lot of governors look very good and now some are in a shutdown and some aren’t, we’d like to see it open up and open up as soon as possible. But we’re very proud of the job we’ve done, and we’ve saved a lot of lives, a tremendous number of lives.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","03:59"
"George Stephanopoulos","Mr. President, you mentioned a number of things. Let’s talk about the mortality first, because you said we’re doing better in mortality than other countries. But here’s this chart right here. It shows the United States is right here. This is number of deaths per million residents. Here’s Western Europe here, Canada way down there. We’re not at the top of the list.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","04:28"
"Donald Trump","The excess mortality rate is among the best in the whole world. I mean, I can show you there’s a chart that just came out a little while ago. Excess mortality rate is compared to Europe, compared to other places, it’s about 25% better. In one case, it’s over 60% better. And we also have a very big country here. This is, we’re talking about a lot bigger than most countries. When you look at testing, just as an example, when India does 40 million less tests than us, they have 1.5 billion people. China, you don’t get the accurate numbers out of China, but China, they lost a lot of people. They just don’t say what-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","04:44"
"George Stephanopoulos","Actually, we have 4% of the world’s population, more than 20% of the cases, more than 20% of the deaths.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","05:22"
"Donald Trump","Well, we have 20% of the cases because of the fact that we do much more testing. If we wouldn’t do testing, you wouldn’t have cases. You would have very few cases.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","05:28"
"George Stephanopoulos","As you know, Dr. Fauci, says most of these are actual cases.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","05:35"
"Donald Trump","Well, Dr. Fauci, said we’ve done a fantastic job. He just said it yesterday. Actually, he said we’ve done a fantastic job that we didn’t mislead anybody. Now. I’m not going to make people feel like I want to… Look, with a leader of a great country, we want to keep it that way. I don’t want to scare people. I don’t want to make people panic and you’re not going to go out and say, “Oh, this is going to be. This is death, death, death.” You have to run a country. We’re in a country. We got hit by something very unfairly.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","05:38"
"Donald Trump","What I noticed yesterday Dr. Fauci, said that we’ve done a really good job and we didn’t mislead anybody. He came out with that statement, which I appreciate. But whether it’s Dr. Fauci, or anybody else, a lot of people got it wrong. They talked about, don’t wear masks, and now they say wear masks, although some people say don’t wear masks. I mean, you have a lot of different ideas. Some people say, “Just leave it the way it is and don’t do any shutdowns.” Other people say, “Do shutdowns.” I have my own views on that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","06:08"
"George Stephanopoulos","What did you get wrong? You say a lot of people got things wrong. I mean, you mentioned China at the top right there. All through January and February, you were down playing by your own admission, the severity of the crisis that you didn’t want to panic people.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","06:37"

"Donald Trump","I don’t want to drive our nation into a panic. I’m a cheerleader for this nation. I’m the one that closed up our country. I closed it up long before any of the experts thought I should and saved hundreds of thousands of lives. But when I closed it, I put a ban on our country. And the ban was a very important ban because China [crosstalk 00:07:12]. China was heavily infected.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","06:54"
"Donald Trump","By the way, I read where other people said, “Do it.” No people that I saw said do it, and I know they said security advisers and others. I put a ban on when it wasn’t at all popular. Joe Biden said I was xenophobic because I put the ban on, and I thought that was a very unfair. By the way, he’s totally taken that back. But I’m not sure he knows what it means, anyway.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","07:15"
"George Stephanopoulos","I want to ask you about China though, because at that time you were actually praising President Xi. You were saying he was transparent. You were saying he was strong. You were saying he was doing a good job. Did you get that wrong? Did you misjudge President Xi?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","07:36"
"Donald Trump","I don’t think I did. We just finished a trade deal. We just had the largest order of corn in the history of our country last week, the largest order of soybeans, largest order of beef, because they know I’m very unhappy. They know I’m very, very-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","07:48"

"Donald Trump","No, I didn’t say one way or the other. I’m not saying one way or the other. At the beginning before anybody knew what it was, I spoke with President Xi and he said, “We are doing it well. We are having it under control.” And I was very open with that. He told me that it was under control, that everything was, and it turned out to be not true, because it wasn’t under control. It went all over the world, 188 countries.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","08:02"
"Donald Trump","I didn’t say anything bad about President Xi initially, because nobody knew much about the disease. Nobody knew the seniors are susceptible. They thought people would be susceptible, but not… The seniors are really a very, very endangered group of people, especially if they have problems with hearts or diabetes or any of that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","08:25"
"George Stephanopoulos","You mentioned masks. We had Julie Bard, who’s from Gibsonia, Pennsylvania. She’s right here. She has a question about that. You voted for Hillary Clinton last time, I believe.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","08:43"
"Julie Bard","Yes, I did. The wearing of mask has proven to lessen the spread of COVID. Why don’t you support a mandate for national mass wearing, and why don’t you wear a mask more often?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","08:51"
"Donald Trump","Well, I do wear them when I have to, and when I’m in hospitals and other locations. But I will say this, they said at the Democrat Convention, they’re going to do a national mandate. They never did it, because they’ve checked out and they didn’t do it. A good question, as you ask, like Joe Biden, they said, “We’re going to do a national mandate unrest-”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","09:02"

"Donald Trump","No, but he didn’t do it. I mean, he never did it. By the way, a lot of people don’t want to wear masks. There are a lot of people think that masks are not good. And there are a lot of people that, as an example, you have-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","09:26"

"Donald Trump","I’ll tell you who those people are, waiters. They come over and they serve you, and they have a mask. I saw it the other day where they were serving me and they’re playing with a mask. I’m not blaming them. I’m just saying what happens. They’re playing with a mask, and so the mask is over and they’re touching it. And then they’re touching the plate. That can’t be good.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","09:39"
"Donald Trump","There are a lot of people, if you look at Dr. Fauci’s original statement, you look at a lot of people, CDC, you look at a lot of people’s original statement, they said very strongly George, “Don’t wear masks.” Then all of a sudden they want to wear masks. The concept of a mask is good, but it also does, you’re constantly touching it, you’re touching your face, you’re touching plates. There are people that don’t think masks are good.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","09:58"

How are you?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","10:22"
"Johnny Powell","Hello. Hi. My question is, if you believe it’s the president’s responsibility to protect America, why would you downplay a pandemic that is known to disproportionately harm low income families and minority communities?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","10:31"
"Donald Trump","Yeah. Well, I didn’t downplay it. I actually, in many ways I applied it in terms of action. [crosstalk 00:10:54]. My action was very strong because what I did was with China, I put a ban on, with Europe, I put a ban on, and we would have lost thousands of more people had I not put the ban on. So that was called action. Not with the mouth, but in actual fact, we did a very, very good job when we put that ban on, whether you call it talent or luck, it was very important. So we saved a lot of lives when we did that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","10:47"

"Donald Trump","Well, they were Americans. I mean, the holes in were if you have somebody in China, that’s an American citizen, we had to let them in. I mean, there were actually some people that said, well, once it got going, they said, “Wait a minute. That is really a heavily infected place.” We had a case where we had a lot of Americans, they probably had COVID and we’re saying, “Do we let them into our country?” We let them in very carefully. We quarantined them, but we let them in. But yeah, they say that we allowed certain people and it’s true, but they were American citizens.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","11:22"

"Donald Trump","No, I think we did a great job. If we didn’t close the country, look, we created, I created, we all created it together. You helped everybody. The fact is, we created the greatest economy in the history of the world, best employment numbers for African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American, women, everything, the best employment, high school, no high school, college. We had the best economy we’ve ever had. 160 million people almost, just short of 160 million people. We were never closed.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","12:12"
"Donald Trump","And then somebody comes in and then somebody else, doctors, and they start talking about the pandemic and about closing, they want to close up our country. I said, “Wait a minute. We have the greatest country, the greatest economy.” And it was coming together, even in terms of unity, because it was so successful that people that weren’t getting along were starting to get along, George. That’s the way we solved that problem. But we had the greatest economy ever, and we have to close it. If I didn’t close it, I think you’d have 2 million deaths instead of having the 185, 190.

"George Stephanopoulos","But Dr. Fauci, say we have to hunker down. We have to be prepared for a possible second wave. I understand that you don’t want to panic people. You said you want people to be calm. You’ve often talked about Winston Churchill, and FDR, and they did reassure people. They were strong. They did keep people calm, but they also were straight. They said, “This war is going to be tough. It’s going to be a real fight.

"Donald Trump","When Churchill was on the top of a building, and he said, “Everything’s going to be good. Everything’s going to be.

You’ll have people joke, make mistakes, and they happen. It happens where they have to make a fast decision and some bad things happen. And you also have bad apples, but you have 99% great people.

They’ve done a fantastic job in many locations, but then bad things happen. Look at New York, New York was a very safe city. Rudy Giuliani did a fantastic job. The city was safe, and then all of a sudden we have a mayor. He starts cutting the police force and crime is up a hundred percent, 150%.

If you talk about make America great, if you look at just prior to, and I’m talking about for the black community, you look just prior to this horrible situation coming in from China, when the virus came in, that was probably the highest point. Home ownership for the black community, home ownership, lower crime, the best jobs they’ve ever had, highest income, the best employment numbers they’ve ever had. If you go back and you want to look over many years, you could just go back six or seven months from now, that was the best single moment in the history of the African-American people in this country, I think, I would say.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","25:25"

Quite frankly, under your administration, under Obama’s administration, under the Bush, under the Clinton, the very same things happen, and the very same systems and cycles continue to ensue, and we need to see, because you say again, we need to see when was that great, because that pushes us back to a time in which we cannot identify with such greatness.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","26:21"

When you look at income levels, and a lot of things, because of the job situation, where they had the lowest income, the best unemployment numbers they’ve ever had, the black community, by far, and that was solving a lot of problems. You know what else? It was bringing people together. I was starting to get, just before… We were having a long run of success.

When it hit my brain, I was automatically eligible for disability for the rest of my life. I chose instead to get a bachelor’s degree, a master’s degree, a PhD, and become a professor.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","36:56"

We’re not going to hurt preexisting conditions, and in fact, just the opposite. If you look at what they want to do, where they have socialized medicine, they will get rid of preexisting conditions. If they go into Medicare for all, which is socialized medicine, and you can forget about your doctors and your plans, just like you can forget under President Obama. He said you can have your doctor, you can have your plan, and that turned out to be a lie. He said it 28 different times, at least. We have 28 different times. You can have your doctor, you can have your plan. Well, it’s not true. But, what we’re doing is we’re going to be doing a healthcare plan, preexisting, protecting people with preexisting conditions. As an example, yourself. It sounds like that’s exactly perfect. That’s exactly what we’re talking about. We’re going to be doing a healthcare plan very strongly, and protect people with preexisting conditions.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","38:22"

If you look at John Bolton, John Bolton, all he wanted to do is blow people up. He wanted to go to war with everybody. And frankly, I used him very nicely. I bring him into a room in a negotiation, when people saw them, they said, “Oh wow, he’s going to go to war.” I’m bringing our troops back from Afghanistan. I’m bringing our troops back from Iraq. We’re almost out of almost every place. Everybody said because of my personality, they said, “He’ll be in a war immediately.” Look at North Korea, how that’s worked out.

So instead of wars, everybody said, look at what we had today with the United Arab Emirates, UAE, and just take a look at what happened with Israel today with that. Take a look at what’s going on.

Tom Friedman of the New York Times wrote incredible glowing articles last week about this incredible thing that I’ve been able to do in the Middle East. A guy like Jim Mattis could have never done it because they were all doing it the old fashioned way. They were going in the wrong outlets and the wrong doors. And what happened today with the UAE, and with Bahrain, and with Israel, people don’t even believe it. And George, as sure as you’re sitting there, I have numerous other countries in that region that are going to be signing very soon also. You’ll have peace in the Middle East, and this is without war and without losing, and I’m talking about on both sides, but without losing our great young soldiers.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","58:19"

And there’s no sadder thing than to sit with a widow or a mother and watch these big, massive cargo planes, and that back opens up and these incredible Marines are walking off a casket and they were killed in the Middle East. And in many ways, nobody even knows why. Going there was the worst decision in the history of our country. We’ve spent $8 trillion and we’ve lost thousands of lives, but really millions of lives because I view both sides. Okay? If that’s okay. Millions of lives, this was the worst decision. And by the way, Iraq did not… Saddam Hussein did not knock down the World Trade Center in case you don’t know, and I’m sure you do know that. They said they had weapons of mass destruction, they made a mistake. So we’re now $8 trillion. We’ve been in there for 20 years, almost 20 years in Afghanistan.

"Alexander","Hello Mr. Trump. My question is actually about police reform. And how can we balance common sense police reform without sacrificing public safety in a time when part of the country is calling to defund the police and actively cheering when they’re gunned down in the street, and another part is tired of seeing the lawlessness?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","01:06:12"
"Donald Trump","So we have a great Senator named Tim Scott from South Carolina, and he had a plan that was very much of a compromise plan, but it was a plan that everybody pretty much agreed to. A lot of Democrats agreed to it, but they wouldn’t vote for it. And it was a really good, it was a compromise of a lot of different factors, and it didn’t get done, and it should have gotten done and it could still be out there, it could still be resurrected very easily, but they just didn’t want to do it. Because I think the Democrats are viewing this as a political issue, and I probably agree with them. I think it’s very bad for them because we’re about law and order, we have to be about law and order. Otherwise you’re going to see your cities burn and that’s the way it is.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","01:06:30"
"Donald Trump","If we can do a plan like Tim Scott’s plan, which is really, it goes far enough, but it doesn’t take the dignity away from our police. We have incredible people. They’ve been protecting us for a long time. I mean, we are here, and I feel very safe being in this room. These are great people. We can’t take their dignity away. We have to let them be able to do what they do better than anybody else. So I think we have to look at it that way. We have to be very, very careful. Police are so afraid today, that they do something slightly wrong, slightly wrong, and their pension’s gone, their job’s gone, who knows what happens? Their life is ruined, their wife or their husband will leave, the whole thing, it’s a very scary thing to do.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","01:07:10"

You look at that. This is a very tough job and it’s a very unsafe job. It’s a very dangerous job. We have to give them back their dignity and we have to give them back respect. These are great people, for the most part. There’s always going to be a bad apple in your business, in my business, no matter what. I mean, there’s going to be bad apples so we have to weed out the bad apples, but we have to give the police back that strength that they had a short while ago and that they have in Republican cities, frankly, and states.

I can call insurrection, but there’s no reason to ever do that. Even in a Portland case. We can’t call in the National Guard unless we’re requested by a governor. If a governor or a mayor is a Democrat, like in Portland, we call them constantly. I just spoke to the governor yesterday, because we’re giving them relief from the fires. We’re giving them an emergency declaration. I said, “Governor, let us go in and we’ll clean up Portland so fast. In a half an hour, it’ll be all right.” And she’s just torn by it. I don’t understand the thinking, but they are torn by it.

In Seattle, we let them know we’re coming in. They took over a big chunk of the city, 20% of the city. We said, “We’re coming in.” As soon as we said that the police department went in and these other people were exhausted, but had we not said we’re going in, we were ready to go in, we were going in the following morning, wherever you have a Democrat city, not in all cases, but if you look at the really troubled cities in our country, they’re Democrat-run and that’s Biden.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","01:09:56"

And the thing I don’t really get is that the news media is saying, “No, these are peaceful. These are peaceful.” And right over the reporter, it was a CNN reporter, right over his shoulder, and you saw that, right over his shoulder, the city is burning.

And it’s a very sad story, but we want people to come into our country. We want them to come in, a lot of people, but we want them to come in through a legal system, through a system that they love our country, they work to come into our country, a merit system, and we’re working on something very hard right now and in a very short time, we’re going to be announcing it.

What she’s done with you, the way you are, the love that you have for your mother, I can see that. It’s hard, and so many people, and they die alone. They die alone because this is such a vicious thing. You can’t go there and hold their hand. You can’t give them a kiss goodnight. It’s a terrible, terrible thing.

We have many things now and things are going to be announced soon, which frankly, if you take a look at some of the things we’re doing in terms of the word wouldn’t be cure, but the word would be therapeutically or therapeutics, we have some incredible things which is so important. And I view that actually in a certain way is more important than the vaccine where you can go into a hospital and get your mother and give her a transfusion or a shot and they can get better, get better much faster. So we have some of those things and they’ve been very, very successful, but we have others coming out and in order to get them, we had to get the FDA to approve these products, these very sophisticated medicines, I guess you could call them medicine, but we had to get them approved very quickly and they did it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","01:20:26"

"Ashley West","Sorry. My question is, what has been the most difficult part of your presidency and what have you learned from it?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","01:27:21"
"Donald Trump","So I think without question, I would say, because things were going so well, I think I’d have to say the whole COVID, the China virus as I call it because it comes from China so I think it’s a much more accurate term. But it’s been very difficult, it’s been so sad. As an example, talking to you about your mother, it’s just such a sad situation. Yeah, we’re getting there, we will get there, we’re going to, it’s going to happen, but it’s been very difficult, nobody’s seen anything like this probably since 1970 [inaudible 01:28:03].","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","01:27:29"

"Donald Trump","I learned that life is very fragile. I knew people that were powerful people, strong people, good people, and they got knocked out by this and died. Six people. It was five until about two weeks ago, now it’s six. But I’ve learned that life is very fragile because these were strong people and all of a sudden they were dead, they were gone, and it wasn’t their fault. It was the fault of a country that could have stopped it. And I made a great trade deal with China,","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","01:28:07"

"Donald Trump","I feel so differently about that deal now. It’s a great deal. It was good for the farmers, good for the manufacturers, but I don’t view it the same way. It was good for us, but I don’t view it the same way because of the horror of this disease that really could have been stopped at the border.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","01:28:41"

"Donald Trump","I don’t think so. I think what I did by closing up the country, I think I saved two, maybe two and a half, maybe more than that lives. I really don’t think so. I think we did a very good job. I don’t know if that’s been recognized. We’ve made a lot of governors feel good. We’ve made some, reputationally. We’ve enhanced their reputation. They didn’t have anything, we got them the supplies, we got them the ventilators. We’ve made a lot of people look good that shouldn’t look good to be honest with you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-abc-news-town-hall-transcript-with-george-stephanopoulos-in-philadelphia","Donald Trump ABC News Town Hall Transcript with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia","01:28:59"
