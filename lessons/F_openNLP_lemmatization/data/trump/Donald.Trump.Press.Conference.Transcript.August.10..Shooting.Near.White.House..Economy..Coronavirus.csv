"President Trump","Thank you very much. Sorry for that. there was a shooting outside of the White House and seems to be very well under control. I’d like to thank the Secret Service for doing their always quick and very effective work, but there was an actual shooting and somebody has been taken to the hospital. I don’t know the condition of the person. It seems that the person was shot by Secret Service so we’ll see what happens … And yeah. Did you have something?

"President Trump","No, there were no details. We just found out just now. It was outside of the White House, this area right over here. And they’ll have details for you in a little while. Somebody is taken to the hospital. It seems that the shooting was done by law enforcement at that person, at the suspect. It was the suspect who was shot. And this just took place. A couple of people outside. I noticed a man named John Roberts, who you know very well. He reported that he heard shots. He was outside and he heard two shots.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","00:44"

I think it’s probably pretty unusual, but very, very professional people that do a fantastic job as you know. So it seems to me, it seems to be, from what I was said, there was a shooting. It was a law enforcement, shot someone, seems to be the suspect. And the suspect is now on the way to the hospital.

"President Trump","I don’t know. I didn’t ask that question. It might not have had anything to do with me. It might’ve been something else, but it was on the outside of the premises, the wall, as you know, the fencing, especially the new fencing they put up is very powerful, but it was on the outside of the White House. Okay? And they’ll have a full report, Secret Service. In a little while, we’ll have a full report.q","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","02:46"

"President Trump","I don’t know. Do I seem rattled? It’s unfortunate that this is a world, but the world’s always been a dangerous place. It’s not something that’s unique.

"President Trump","No, I feel very safe with Secret Service. They’re fantastic people. They’re the best of the best and they’re highly trained. I don’t know if anybody got to walk outside, but there were a lot of terrific looking people ready to go if something was necessary, people at the highest level of law enforcement. There’s nobody like these people. So they just wanted me to step aside for a little while just to make sure that everything was cleared outside because it was right in this area.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","03:37"

"President Trump","Well, I didn’t even think about not coming back. I said, “Am I able to go back?” And they said, “You’d have to wait a little while.” I waited a little while, as you know, in the Oval Office area. And I said, “Can I get back now?” And they said, “Yes.” And they have a lot of fortification outside just in case, but it was one person. Okay?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","04:18"

"President Trump","I can only tell you they’re going to give you a briefing. It was outside of the premises. Near the fence, but outside of the premises.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","04:46"
"Speaker 2","But it was near the fence. So pretty close to here.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","04:53"
"President Trump","Yeah, pretty close. So I was telling you that the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 are now 50% above the March level. NASDAQ is setting new records. It’s already broken the record despite the situation of having the China virus. We have new jobs are rising and unemployment is falling faster than nearly anyone thought. And over the past three months, we’ve created over 9 million jobs and that’s a record, a three months record. If you added it up, it’s a three month record by far. And we’ve beaten expectations by 12 million. We’re 12 million above expectations, which is pretty remarkable.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","04:55"
"President Trump","Today we had great reports on new job openings and there’s clearly a housing boom, which has been incredible numbers in both housing and an automobile boom. We’ve rarely seen anything it and it’s going on right now in America. Inventories are at rock bottom, used car sales are at record levels, and we will have rebuilt … We’re doing a rebuilding like nobody’s ever seen. It’s a big plus for manufacturing and construction, so construction’s getting close to record territory. Manufacturing is doing very well. The car companies are doing great. Very happy for Michigan, the state of Michigan. We have a lot of car companies moving in. A lot of plants are being built and expanded in Michigan and Ohio. There is no reason why the economy can’t grow at a 20% pace in the third quarter. That would be a record.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","05:43"
"President Trump","And interestingly, it will be a number that’s going to be announced before November 3rd. It gets announced probably around November 1st, which is very interesting. But it’s going to grow at a very substantial pace based on all of the numbers we’re looking at and probably a lot more substantial than we originally thought. We’re creating new incentives for working jobs. We’re also providing much needed assistance to those who are still suffering from the effects of the pandemic contraction. And the contraction is now while we have the pandemic, we have a lot of great things happening in terms of the vaccines and therapeutics, as you know. And I think we’ll be making tremendous progress over the next period of a few months and certainly before the end of the year. I think we’ll have a vaccine before the end of the year, very substantially. And we may have a therapeutic resolvement very quickly. Very, very quickly.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","06:40"
"President Trump","And frankly, that’s the one I’d rather have faster because you’d go in, you’d give a transfusion or a shot to people that are very ill, and they’d be able to come out of the hospital the next day or a few days later. If the states participate in our core sharing unemployment plan, we are going to be doing something very, very interesting with all of the things that we announced on Saturday. I don’t have to repeat what they are, you know very well. And we’ve had some tremendous success already. If you look at what’s happening with the stock market and people are very thrilled at what we’re doing, we’d like to get the Democrats to focus on other than what they’re focusing on, which is a bailout of poorly running states.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","07:39"
"President Trump","We have many great running states, States that are setting records. And let’s see what happens with respect to that. But we’re looking at also considering a capital gains tax cut, which would create a lot more jobs. So we’re looking very seriously at a capital gains tax cut and also at an income tax cut for middle income families. We’re looking at expanding the tax cuts we’ve already done, but specifically for middle income families. And you’ll be hearing about that in the upcoming few weeks. And I think it’ll be very exciting. So a capital gains tax is going to be a lot of people put to work and it would be a cut in the capital gains tax and also a cut in the middle income income tax.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","08:25"
"President Trump","So I now want to just discuss a little quick brief, and then we’ll take a few more questions. But we took some. Who would have known we were going to take questions before we started? Is that right, Jennifer? But that’s the way it happens sometimes. We want to discuss, if we might, the China virus and the world continues its fight against this horrible plague. Countries in every continent are seeing increases in cases. We have a rapid increase only in cases where … It’s very interesting because we’re so far ahead of testing, we have more cases. If we had much smaller testing, would have fewer, but we feel that having testing is a very important thing. It’s a great record to have. In many ways we’ve tested, I guess, close to 65 million people right now. And nobody’s even close to that number. No other country is close.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","09:19"
"President Trump","India would be second at 11 million and they have 1.5 billion people. So we have the number one testing anywhere in the world by far. And we also have, I think, the highest quality tests. We have a lot of different ones, but we have the highest quality including the short term and the lab tests. The lab tests take a little bit longer. And Dr. Burks was telling me a little while ago that we’re down to two days and two and a half days on getting your result on the lab tests. The other ones, you get them in five minutes to 15 minutes. So that’s exciting. But countries in every continent are seeing increases in cases in recent days. Cases have rapidly increased in Japan and Australia, unfortunately, and they’re now experiencing higher peaks than they did in March. To the south of a border, of our border, cases have continued to surge in Mexico, Central America, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, and throughout Latin America.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","10:16"
"President Trump","It’s really the hotspot. It’s posing a major challenge for this continent. Latin America is now the region with the most number of confirmed cases by far despite a relative scarcity of testing. So when you think of that, that means it’s pretty much on fire, having a hard time. We’re helping them. We’re sending them tremendous numbers of ventilators, which we’re making by the thousands every month. And we’re helping Latin America very much. It’s hard for them to come into the country because we have big sections of wall up now. The new wall is being built, which people don’t talk about. They used to talk about nothing but the wall. Now that it’s being built, they’re not talking about it so much, but it’s helped us because we’re up to almost … We’re getting close to 280 miles, 280 miles in the most important areas.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","11:15"
"President Trump","So that’s helping us a lot in terms of not having people come in to the country who are infected with the coronavirus. This global trend underscores the persistence of the virus, including the nations that apply the strictest and most punishing lockdowns. You have nations that are really tough on the lockdowns and they’re getting hit very hard. That’s why my administration is pursuing a science-based approach that protects the most vulnerable, preserves hospital capacity, and focuses on the delivery and development of treatments and ultimately the vaccine. I feel strongly that we will have a vaccine by the end of the year and it’ll be put in service maybe even as we get it because we’re all set militarily. We’re using our military to distribute the vaccine and logistically-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","12:08"
"President Trump","… to distribute the vaccine and logistically there’s nobody like this group of people. I meet with them a lot and they’re ready to go. Soon as they have it, they’ll be going. But more importantly, the therapeutics, as I said, I think the therapeutics could be great. Initially speaking, I think that would be if I had my choice, but you’re going to have them both. You’re going to have a boat. You’re going to have them both very soon, too.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","13:03"
"President Trump","At the same time, we urge all Americans to apply common sense mitigation. You all know what that mitigation is. Everybody knows it by heart now. Nearly half of all of the deaths from the China virus in the United States have occurred in nursing homes and longterm care facilities. That’s why we have delivered funding, equipment and rapid testing to our nation’s nursing homes to protect those at high risk. We’re very focused on nursing homes and senior citizens’ areas. Anywhere that we have senior citizens, we’re very, very focused. We’ve delivered over 1,800 rapid point of care testing devices, those are very quick, and shipped over 700,000 tests to nursing homes. Nursing homes are being protected like never before.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","13:24"
"President Trump","The United States faces a unique range of challenges that requires our constant vigilance. America has the largest at risk population of any developed country by far, 1.5 million residents of nursing homes, about five times out of the United Kingdom and other European countries. Our country also has a higher prevalence of underlying conditions that this virus targets. Yet we have fewer deaths per capita than the United Kingdom and most other peer nations in Western Europe. So that’s an important, we have fewer deaths per capita than the United Kingdom and most other nations in Western Europe and heading for even stronger numbers.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","14:13"
"President Trump","But one person is too much as far as I’m concerned. Should have never been allowed to happen. Should have never been allowed to escape China. Nationwide we continue to see encouraging signs. In the last seven days, nationwide cases declined by 14%. Hospitalizations decreased by 7%. Fatalities decreased by 9%. Arizona and Florida are improving rapidly with fewer patients coming to emergency rooms by far as well as decreasing cases, decreasing fatalities, and expanded hospital capacity. So we have an expanded hospital capacity. It’s pretty dramatic when you look at it, meaning we have more room, should we need it. So a lot of tremendous work has been done.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","14:56"
"President Trump","In Texas, likewise, the number of patients going to emergency rooms has dropped from July by more than two thirds. That’s a lot. Nevertheless, we continue to monitor Texas very closely. Terrific governor, terrific people working on that whole situation in Texas, especially at its test positivity rate, which rose over 20% this weekend. Overall cases in Texas are coming down and have stabilized in the border counties. That’s again where you have the wall and you’re next to, in some cases the wall, in some cases you’ll have it very shortly. You’ll have it all built within a number of months. But those areas were hit very hard. And they’re likely cases from Mexico that come in, back and forth from the border. They come in illegally.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","15:45"
"President Trump","As doctors have found more effective ways to treat patients, the fatality rate continues to improve. Texas has one sixth the vitality rate of New York and New Jersey that they had in April. And if you look at New York and New Jersey, they work very, very hard, but very heavy density. And they had a lot of different kinds of difficulty. The fatality rates in Florida and Arizona are between 25% and 33% of the peak rates of New York and New Jersey. Again, different climate, a different grouping, a different density, tremendously different density.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","16:40"
"President Trump","In California the situation is starting to stabilize and improve throughout the major metropolitan areas. Statewide hospitalizations continue to decline very substantially with about 20% fewer inpatients now than on July 21st. California starting to really show signs of correcting. We’re monitoring regions with increasing cases including Boston, Chicago, and the Midwest. And we’re monitoring them very, very strongly and very, very hard. I do want to say that I think at the end of a fairly short period of time, you’re going to be in very, very good shape all over our country. Every loss of life is tragic and all nations must work together to defeat this horrible virus. My administration is going to continue to save as many lives as possible. We are working around the clock. Everybody, it’s incredible how hard they’re working and people from other countries, we’re working with them also and they’re working very hard.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","17:19"
"President Trump","This is something that’s now attacked 188 different countries. There are a wide range of factors that determine how the virus impacts a nation such as age, underlying conditions. Underlying conditions is a very big one to you. If you’re sick in any way, if you’re, especially they say heart and diabetes, that’s not a good thing to have if you’re going to have this, if you’re going to catch it. So we’re trying to protect especially those people that have problems with their heart or diabetes and levels of preexisting immunity resulting from past exposure to other viruses which happens. We must stop politicizing the virus and instead be united in our condemnation of how this virus came to America, how this virus came to the world and we’re going to figure it out and we’re going to find out and we’re very angry about it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","18:23"
"President Trump","On the therapeutics and vaccine updates, three vaccine candidates are currently in phase three clinical trial, something that would have been impossible under the previous administration or any other administration. And several others are showing considerable promise. We have great companies, very well known companies. I think everyone in this room would know these companies, but they’re the biggest and the best in the world. And we’re working with other foreign companies and countries that have been really working very closely with us. We’re trading, we’re not looking to do anything but come up with the answer and we really don’t, we don’t care. We want to come up with the answer. If it’s one of ours or one of theirs, it’s okay. We have to come up with the answer and we’re very close to getting it. Some people think we have it. We may have it. We have the best scientists in the world racing to develop a safe vaccine that will end this pandemic, save millions of lives and that’s millions of lives all over the world and then the harm inflicted by this virus to our society and to all other nations.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","19:25"
"President Trump","Last week, the NIH began a clinical trial of remdesivir paired with another approved antiviral drug and anti-inflammatory drug. You know that remdesivir has been very successful. And now they’re experimenting with others, including antivirals and antiinflammatories, and they’re having some very interesting success. We’ve secured enough remdesivir to treat over 650,000 patients. On Saturday I took executive action in a signing to save American jobs and support American workers. I signed directives to give a payroll tax holiday with the understanding that after the election, on the assumption that it would be victorious for an administration that’s done a great job, we will be ending that tax, will be terminating that tax. On the other hand, the other group wants to raise taxes and they may want to leave it where you pay it. But the payroll tax is a big deal for people. It’s a tremendous saving for people and we’re going to be doing it. And we intend to terminate it at the end of the appropriate period of time.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","20:36"
"President Trump","It’s for those making less than $100,000 through the end of 2020, to provide an extra $400 per week also in unemployment benefits and to extend the freeze on home evictions. We want to extend the freeze so people aren’t evicted. It’s not their fault that the virus came from China. It’s China’s fault and to suspend payments on student loans through the end of the year and then beyond. And again, they’re paying interest on loans and they’re not allowed to go to their college. So we’re going to suspend payments on student loans through the end of the year, and then another extension most likely, because it’s not fair to the students to have to pay when the colleges aren’t doing the job of getting open. And I think probably many of them could be open. So I want to thank you all. I’m sorry for the disturbance before. Things happen and if you’d like, we’ll take a few questions. Yeah.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","21:53"

"President Trump","We just had a meeting with the governors and they were very anxious to get money for the people in their states. And if they, depending on the state, we have the right to do what we want to do. We can terminate the 25% or we don’t have to do that. So we’ll see what it is. It depends on the individual state, but a lot of money will be going to a lot of people very quickly. And I’ve instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to move as quickly as he can, right?

"President Trump","Well, I don’t know if he was closer or not, he or she. I don’t know if it was a he or she, but I have such confidence in these people. They’re so good.

In Ohio, a few days ago, you said, and I’ll quote, “Joe Biden has hurt God, he’s against God.” The Vice President has said that he’s a man of deep Catholic faith, that he’s credited for helping him endure some immense personal tragedy. So what did you mean by that when you say that Joe Biden has hurt God or is against God?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","26:27"
"President Trump","Well, if you look at the manifesto that they’ve come up with, and if you look at their stance on religion and things having to do very importantly with aspects of religion and faith, I don’t think a man of deep religion would be agreeing to the Bernie Sanders plan. You take a look at what they have in, and you can’t put that into the realm of a religious group of people. I will say that. And I think it’s one of the reasons why, if you look at polls, which I’m not a big believer in polls. If I was, I guess I wouldn’t be standing here right now. And by the way, our poll numbers are going up very rapidly, as you know. And Joe’s are going down very rapidly. He’ll have to come out of the basement, it looks like pretty soon. Because it’s one of those things.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","26:44"
"President Trump","But no, if you look at the manifesto. I call it the manifesto, a lot of people are calling it the manifesto. My opinion is further left than where Bernie was before. So normally he’d be left and you’d bring it somewhere a little bit toward the center. But some of the things that they have down there, and I’m not only talking in terms of religion, I’m not talking even in terms of religion. But some of the things they have in the agreement made, and this wasn’t agreement made by Bernie Sanders and Joe, it’s a terrible thing. It would be a terrible thing for our country. It will destroy our country. We will go into a depression. We will put on regulation. We will double and triple taxes. It will be terrible for healthcare. Just terrible. You’ll have 180 million people lose their healthcare. It will be a terrible, terrible thing for our country. Okay. Yeah, please.

"Speaker 8","Thank you, sir. I’d like to ask you a question about something you said in Bedminster as well. You said that you’re planning to issue an executive order to ensure that health insurance companies prevent or cover people with preexisting conditions. And you said that had never been done before, but that’s not the case, because that is the law under the Affordable Care Act. So my question is, why do you need to issue an executive [crosstalk 00:28:49] order for a law that is already existing?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","28:27"
"President Trump","But I didn’t say that. I said as an executive order. As you said, I said as an executive order it hasn’t been done before. We want to be able to assure people that preexisting condition is always taken care of. As you know, we’ve done tremendous things having to do with the individual mandate. We got rid of the individual mandate from Obamacare. Which really ended Obamacare as it would be officially known, because the individual mandate was the biggest part. It was also the most unpopular part, where you pay for a terrible privilege of overpaying for insurance. You pay not to have to pay for your healthcare. And that was a disaster for people, and very unpopular.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","28:51"
"President Trump","That was called the individual mandate. And we terminated that. And officially terminated that. And that was something that we have been given thanks for it by many, many people. But the individual mandate will always be with us, the individual mandate termination will always be, they can’t start it up. In fact, I don’t even believe, you’ll have to tell me, I don’t believe it’s been challenged when we ended it. And preexisting conditions, the Republicans are 100% there. And I’ll be issuing, at some point in the not too distant future, a very strong statement on that. Probably in the form of an executive order.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","29:34"

"President Trump","Just a double safety net, and just to let people know that the Republicans are totally strongly in favor of taking care of people with preexisting conditions.

As you know, I was on the phone with many of them yesterday with respect to Lebanon, which is truly one of the saddest, most catastrophic things I’ve ever seen. And they have no idea how many people have died. They’re having revolution right now in that country. It’s just a terrible thing. But I was, yesterday, eight o’clock in the morning our time, we had a big teleconference call. Some of those people were there. I’m much more inclined to do it sometime after the election, we were going to do it in September. They’d like to do it. We could do it through teleconference or we could do it through a meeting. But I am now suggesting, I told my people yesterday actually, why don’t we do it sometime after the election when things are a little bit … you have a little more time to think about it?

But we will invite certain people that aren’t in the G7. Some people have already accepted, but we’re going to be doing it after the election. I think it’s a better atmosphere to have a G7.

But where has he been for, how many weeks have you been negotiating? Like four? And they should do something. It would have been so much easier than doing it the way we did it.

It was a very important place, and is a very important place in our country. So we’re looking at that, and we’re looking at the White House. The White House would be very much easier for secret service. You see what just went on here, they’re all here. Just like you have your seats, they have their seats at the White House. So there wouldn’t be any expense or any extraordinary expense. And the White House would be a lovely place to do it also. Least expensive place that you could do it would be at the White House. This is a government expense. And look, I watch also with governments, I watch to make sure that we do what’s right. But we’re looking at Gettysburg and we’re looking at the White House.

"Speaker 11","Again, nothing specifically at the moment [inaudible 00:10:18].

"Speaker 11","Oh, I’m sorry. Yeah. So just to be clear, we did make the recommendation. And the SEC will be putting out… Yes, as of the end of next year if they do not fully comply, and that’s Chinese companies, any other companies, they all have to comply with the same exact accounting or they will be delisted on the exchanges.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","36:22"

"Speaker 11","I though you meant sanctions. I was confused when you said delisted.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","36:46"
"President Trump","And Jennifer, we’re also talking on the WTO, the World Trade Organization. China’s treated much differently than we are. This should have been handled many years ago when it first happened, but they are treated as a nation that’s developing. And they’re treated as what they call a developing nation, which gives them tremendous incentives and advantages over and above what the United States gets. And over and above what other countries get also. This is a developing nation. I don’t think so. I don’t think for purposes of what we’re talking about it should be. And we are putting in, and we’ve already put in a request that China should no longer be declared a developing nation, that it have advantages over the US.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","36:46"
"President Trump","And I told them that a year ago, and I told them that two years ago. And we put it in very powerfully that they should not have advantages over other countries, frankly. And they’re not going to have any more advantages over… This should have been done by numerous presidents a long time ago, because it gives them a tremendous boost over everybody else. And it’s a very unfair situation. No, we are upset with China because of what they did. China was not good. And China will be, if you look at what’s going to happen, whether it’s Iran, Iran will make a deal with us in a month after the election’s over if we win the election.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","37:28"
"President Trump","But their greatest dream in the world is that Joe Biden wins, because they will own this country. China will own this country. North Korea will own this country. They will own our country. And they’re all waiting to see the election. And if we have a win on November 3rd, we will have a deal with, in my opinion, Iran within one month. And I don’t know that we want to have a deal with China, to be honest with you. So I’m saying it myself, gee, but China wants us to lose very badly. And you know who else is not happy with us winning? Russia. The phony people that tell the story, the fake news stories about Russia. It was just reported the numbers, I raised $400 million extra in NATO. You know that. It went from 130 to $400 billion, and that’s a year, in order to strengthen up NATO.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","38:11"
"President Trump","That’s a year, in order to strengthen up NATO. Nobody says that. We became the biggest energy exporter. We are now… if you look at what we have, we’re energy independent. So many different things. Our military is stronger than it ever was. We spent $2.5 trillion on our military.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","39:03"
"President Trump","I exposed the terrible deal between Germany and Russia on the pipeline. Nobody even knew about the pipeline. Nord Stream. Nord Stream, too. Nobody knew about it. Nobody talks about it. I said, “What’s this all about?” So we protect Germany from Russia and Germany pays Russia, billions of dollars a year for energy. And it’s a big portion of Germany’s energy. If I was a person that was a German citizen, I would not be happy with that deal, because they were at a very big disadvantage. So, no, Russia would not be happy.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","39:20"
"President Trump","And I can tell you that China would not be happy at all. We’ve taken in tens of billions of dollars as your head of the treasury, Steve, right? We’ve taken in tens of billions of dollars from China. We never took 25 cents from China, never, not even 25 cents. And $28 billion we gave to our farmers because they were targeted by China. They were actually targeted and we gave $28 billion compliments of China to our great farmers and ranchers, because they were unfairly targeted by China in order to make a better deal with us. I said, “We’re not going to do that. We’re going to, instead of making a better deal, we’re going to tariff you at very high numbers, 25%, 10%, and actually numbers that could go up a lot.” And we had a lot of money left over after giving the 28 billion to the farmers and ranchers and some others, frankly, we had many, many billions of dollars leftover and we’re still receiving that money. Even though we made the deal, we’re still receiving that money.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","39:53"
"President Trump","So if we win the election, we’ll have deals with a lot of countries, very fast. They’re just waiting to see who wins because they are hoping, they are hoping that Joe Biden wins. Sleepy Joe. And if he wins, you know what’s going to happen? China will own us. Our markets will crash. The 401ks will go down to practically nothing. Stocks will go down to practically nothing. Remember stocks, there’s these big companies, they’re owned by millions of people that are carpenters and policemen and farmers and lots of other people. And they are the ones that benefit by having a good stock market, probably more than anybody else. But the 401ks, the stocks, the economy will be in a shambles.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","40:56"
"President Trump","They want to raise taxes. They want to triple taxes. They want to raise the corporate tax, but they want to raise all taxes. Ultimately, they can’t pay for what they want to do anyway. And what they’re going to do is destroy your health care and destroy so many other things. We’re going to have 180 million people that are so happy with their private health care. They’re going to lose it under this crazy plan that these people are proposing. You will have a crash like you’ve never seen before. And I’ve been very good at predicting these things. Yeah, please go ahead.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","41:47"
"Speaker 13","Thank you, sir. You just mentioned the President Putin, possibility of inviting him because he’s important. You’re own Director of National Intelligence has said that Russia is currently planning or actually meddling in the election. Have you raised that directly with Putin ever?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","42:17"
"President Trump","They said China, Russia, Iran, and probably others. But because of the fake news, they seem to think Russia plays the best.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","42:32"

"President Trump","So, what they do… it’s all right. Well, I’m just saying the way the politicians… look the other day, they said the three countries. They said China and Russia and Iran, and some reporter got up and said, “Russia is meddling.” I said, “Well, didn’t it mention China and Iran? Why didn’t you mention them too?” So, I don’t know. You know what I’m telling you?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","42:42"
"President Trump","I’ll tell you who’s meddling in our elections. The Democrats are meddling by wanting and insisting on sending mail in ballots where there’s corruption all over the place. If you check what happened in New York, a small, relatively small race with Carolyn Maloney, and they called her the winner the other day, because I was mentioning it at conferences and getting a lot of action on that statement, so they called her… they declared her the winner and they have no idea who won. And the person, her opponent is very angry, but they had mail in voting and they had hundreds, and I think even thousands of ballots that are missing that were fraudulent. Take a look at the Carolyn Maloney race. Take a look at Patterson, New Jersey. Take a look now at this one in Virginia, where they mailed out 500,000 applications and they’re going to people that aren’t supposed to be getting an application. Yeah, please, go ahead.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","43:01"

"Speaker 14","… this week. Do you have any updates on when the travel restrictions for the EU are going to be listed? It seems strange we’re offering exemptions for professional athletes, but not to K-1 visa holders, the so called-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","44:01"
"President Trump","We’re trying to do the best we can. You have big sporting events and that’s good for our economy. That’s good for us. And they do talk about certain exemptions and they make sure everyone’s perfectly tested and everyone comes in at 100%. But we do make certain accommodations because you do have star athletes, and that means a good thing for the country. That’s economic development, et cetera.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","44:13"
"President Trump","But we are working very closely with Europe and with other countries to see what’s the best time. And don’t forget, I was the one that turned Europe off because they really… they led the way they let it much more so than we did. We were months following them. And in terms of they got hit earlier than we did, quite a bit earlier than we did. So I put the restrictions on Europe. I put the restrictions on China, which was a great thing to do in retrospect. We’re getting, I mean, that was a very important day. Dr. Fauci said that was one of the most important days. And a lot of people didn’t want me to do it, but we first put a ban on anybody from China coming in. And then we put a ban on Europe coming in, but we’re working very closely with Europe to see when that will all come off. Yeah, please.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","44:36"
"Speaker 15","A press conference said that 160,000 people had died on President Obama’s watch.

"President Trump","No, I wouldn’t have done that. I think it’s been amazing what we’ve been able to do. If we didn’t close up our country, we would have had 1.5 or 2 million people already dead. We’ve called it right now, we don’t have to close it. We understand the disease. Nobody understood it because nobody’s ever seen anything like this. The closest thing is in 1917, they say right. The great pandemic certainly was a terrible thing where they lost anywhere from 50 to 100 million people probably ended the Second World War. All the soldiers were sick. That was a terrible situation. And this is highly contagious. This one is highly, highly contagious.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","45:31"
"President Trump","Now, if I would have listened to a lot of people, we would have kept it open. And by the way, we keep it open now all the way. We keep it open. But we would have kept it open and you could be up to 1.5 or 2 million people right now. 1.5 to 2 million people. Our people have done a fantastic jobs. Our consultants and our doctors, and with disagreements and with a lot of things happening. What we’ve done with ventilators has been amazing. What we’ve done with medical equipment has been incredible. We’ve supplied the governors, nobody, not one person in this country that needed a ventilator didn’t get it. And at the beginning there was a big shortage of ventilators. Nobody had stockpiles or anything comparable to what you had to have.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","46:17"
"President Trump","So we would have lost… if you think about it, you had mentioned 160,000 people and multiply that times 10 right now. I think it would have been unsustainable and unacceptable, but that’s what would have happened. Had we kept it open. So, no, I think we’re a very large country. We are… one person, and I say it all the time, a lot of people like to leave that out, one person is too many. It should have never happened, but they’ve done a really, an extraordinary job. They’ll never be given the credit, and I’m not talking about me. The people that have worked on this so hard will never be given the credit, but they’ve done an extraordinary job with a very large, diverse country, really an extraordinary job. And a lot of the governors who, as you know, they sort of do the micro in their states and they go up. And I think I can tell you that a lot of the governors have done an extraordinary job too.

And if they tariff us, although I must tell you, I have a very good relationship with President Bolsonaro. He’s great. And I hear he’s doing well.

"President Trump","I think that as far as Brazil is concerned, if they do tariffs, we have to have an equalization of tariffs. And we are going to be presenting something having to do with tariffs and fairness and fair tariffs, because we have many countries for many years that have been charging us tariffs to do business, and we don’t charge them.

"Speaker 17","… after the scuffle. I have an opinion question for you. Joe Biden is set to announce his running mate at any time now. We expect him to announce her. Many of your supporters feel that the reason that Obama’s former NSA, Susan Rice is on the top of Biden’s list is that she can best cover up a lot of the Obamagate surveillance crimes that had taken place during your campaign. What are your thoughts? What is your opinion? Do you subscribe to that line of thought? How do you feel about it?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-10-shooting-near-white-house-economy-coronavirus","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 10: Shooting Near White House, Economy, Coronavirus","49:12"
"President Trump","Well, look, the Obama campaign spied on our campaign and they’ve been caught. All right. And now let’s see what happens to them, but they have been caught. They’ve been caught red handed. It’s probably treason. It’s a horrible thing they did. It probably never happened before, at least nobody got caught doing it. But they use the intelligence agencies of our country to spy on my campaign and they have been caught. And there are a lot of people involved. I don’t want to say how much she’s involved.
