"Donald Trump","Thank you, President Trump. We do, thank you very much, all, appreciate it. We’re here this morning to announce dramatic action to support our nation’s farmers, ranchers and growers as we work to safely reopen America and it’s happening very fast. Much faster, and with much better numbers than anybody would have thought. I want to begin by expressing our profound gratitude to everyone here today and the farmers and producers across the country, who have kept our nation fed and nourished as we have battled the invisible enemy. It is an invisible enemy. It’s tough, but we’re going to win and we’re going to win very big.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","00:03"
"Donald Trump","But we can never forget all of the people that have been left behind, that have died. For some reason that should’ve never happened, should have never happened. You know that, I know that, and the people that caused the problem, they know that too. It’s too bad. You remind us once again that the American farmers, the backbone of our country, and they’re really a great friend of mine and I appreciate all the support, and I know they appreciate our support. We’re glad to be joined by Secretary Sonny Perdue, along with Ivanka, who has been working closely with Sonny to deliver this vital assistance for farmers and needy families.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","00:42"
"Donald Trump","I’m also grateful to the president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, Zippy Duvall. Thank you very much. Thank you and thank you, Zippy, thank you. The president of the National Cattleman’s Beef Association, Marty Smith. Marty, thank you, Marty. And several of our great agricultural producers, nice to meet all of you. It’s really good to meet you. Zippy, you’re doing okay?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","01:21"

"Zippy Duvall","Yes, sir.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","01:50"
"Donald Trump","Okay. Zippy was married to a great woman. And for purposes of the record, you still are, you always will be, right? She was a great person.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","01:51"

"Donald Trump","Yeah, no. She was a great person. From day one, my administration has been determined to protect our nation’s incredible farmers. We enacted historic tax cuts and helped the family farms stay in the family. What we did is we passed, as you know in the tax cuts, the death tax, the inheritance tax, small farms and ranchers and even businesses, you don’t have to pay it, it’s a big deal. Instead of losing your farm, you keep your farm. I think that was a big deal, what do you think?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","02:02"
"Speaker 2","[inaudible 00:02:34].","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","02:33"
"Donald Trump","Maybe your farm is so big it doesn’t qualify.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","02:33"
"Speaker 2","No, I wish it was.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","02:36"
"Donald Trump","No, but we eliminated that horrible death tax. And most of the kids, many of the kids lost the farm, they go borrow to pay the tax and then they ended up losing the farms, right? You don’t have to pay that tax anymore. I think that’s one of the reasons that farmers like me, I guess, but hopefully that’s not the only reason. We eliminated crushing Washington regulations, kept our promise on ethanol and replaced and negotiated a badly broken trade deals to finally give you a fair and level playing field. When China unfairly targeted our farmers, we provided $28 million in direct assistance. And it came from China, not from our government and you know that happened and they paid for it, we didn’t pay. They have this misconception, they like to say this as much as possible. China devalued their currency in order to pay it. We didn’t pay it. And what we did is we helped. I went to Sonny, we had $12 billion two years ago. We had $16 billion last year. And this year you’ll be hearing about what we’re doing because it’s very substantial. And through the Paycheck Protection Program, we have approved billions of dollars in relief to farmers as part of our unprecedented coronavirus relief efforts. So the paycheck has been a fantastic success as you know. Now we’re standing strong with our farmers and ranchers once again. In normal times, roughly 40% of fresh vegetables and about 40% of beef grown and raised in the United States is distributed to restaurants and other commercial food establishments. But as you know, the virus has forced many of our nation’s restaurants to temporarily close. And this has taken a major toll on our farmers and growers. Some of whom were dealing directly with restaurants. I didn’t realize that until yesterday, we were with the big restaurants and said they sometimes will deal directly with your farmer, no middlemen, no nothing, just directly and it’s a big business.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","02:38"
"Donald Trump","For this reason my administration is launching a sweeping new initiative, the coronavirus food assistance program. Through this effort, we are providing $19 billion to support our nation’s agricultural producers, maintain the health of our critical food supply chains and provide food assistance to American families, $19 billion. No other president’s done this, Zippy. I tell you, you could go back to Abraham Lincoln, there’s no president that’s treated the farmers like Trump. No, no, no. I hear we’re doing well with the farmers, but I can’t imagine … I want to find out who wouldn’t be, who wouldn’t be with Trump, right? But it’s an honor to do it, actually. It’s an honor, they’re great people. These are great, great people. As part of this program today, we’re announcing $16 billion direct payments to farmers and ranchers. So $16 billion is going directly to the farmers and ranchers.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","04:35"
"Donald Trump","And it’s authorized by the Cares Act and the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act. We fought hard for this. These payments will compensate farmers for losses related to the global pandemic, caused by China. We’ll be providing billions of dollars for corn, cotton, soybean and specialty crop farmers, cattle ranchers, just about every category. I think we have almost every category and if we don’t, we’re going to add them, all right. If we left something out, but we have a lot of territory, dairy producers, pork producers, and more. I read yesterday where we take some cattle in from other countries because we have trade deals. I think you should look at terminating those deals, all right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","05:32"
"Donald Trump","We have trade deals where we actually take in cattle and we have a lot of cattle in this country. And I think you should look at the possibility of terminating those trade deals. Now, if a country has been a great country and a great ally and a great friend, you have to do that. But there are some countries that are sending us cattle for many years. And I think we should look at terminating. We’re very self sufficient and we’re becoming more and more self sufficient. Probably one of the reasons I got elected. Sign ups will begin on May 26 through your local farm service agency offices. They got to go sign up to pick it up, to get the money. And we’ll start issuing payments within one week of receiving your application. So that’s a lot of money, you’re talking about a total of $16 billion plus three billion.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","06:18"
"Donald Trump","We bought last week and it’s already in distribution, three billion dollars worth of product for the food lines. Is this already in distribution? I see that they’re handing it out. I see where they couldn’t get food, they’re having a hard time. And we have these incredible ranchers and farmers that have so much food. And I said, let’s spend that money and give it to our farmers, our ranchers and it’s worked out really well. And they’ve already got it in supply, it’s already on the lines. I saw them handing it out today, a couple of days ago, actually, it’s fantastic how quickly it works. In addition, this important initiative also includes a new Farmers to Families Food Box program, which Ivanka and Secretary Perdue helped officially launch on Friday.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","07:11"
"Donald Trump","Through this effort, the Department of Agriculture will work with local food distribution companies and we have a lot of great distribution companies, I’ve gotten to meet some of them. Which have also been hit very hard to purchase three billion dollars of food and produce from the American farmer, which I just mentioned, and to deliver to the food banks and charities that serve needy families. Already, we’ve allocated one point two billion dollars to Farmers to Families, funding through 198 contracts with distribution companies. Many of which are small businesses adversely impacted also by this horrible plague. It’s a plague. Here today are a few of the American farmers and ranchers who can tell us why this program has been so essential and successful. Scott Sink is a cattle producer, his business has been badly impacted by the virus. He says this initiative will provide a bridge to help them move forward. And we’ve been helping them in a lot of other ways too, but this was a great help. And Scott, please come forward. Thank you, Scott.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","07:57"

"Scott Sink","Hi, my name is Scott Sink. I’m a producer in southwest Virginia, Blacksburg. We have a catering business and we do farm to table along with raising livestock, produce and custom hay.

"Scott Sink","Talking to farmers all across the country, farming is something that’s always unexpected. We deal with that. We have to pivot at any time, but with something like this, that’s impacted the supply chain, producers as well as consumers, that’s why having a program like this is very beneficial to all of us.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","09:27"

"Robert Mills Jr.","Thank you, Mr. President. I’m Robert Mills Jr. I’m a first generation farmer from Southside of Virginia. We raised tobacco, beef cattle, poultry, hay, small grain and industrial hemp for CBD. We’re pretty diverse operation and we are diverse because we always expect the unexpected and we want to make sure that we can stay in business and we didn’t expect this. But I will tell the American people that your farmers and your ranchers were out here working each and every day to make sure that those grocery store shelves, stay full and it’s administrations like President Trump’s administration and the forethought that he’s had with the programs that’s been put in place and the one that we’re talking about today. It’s not a rescue program. It’s going to help these farm families be able to make good, wise financial decisions, in the months and weeks and years ahead and it’s also there to let them know that this country is there supporting them because this country relies on what these farmers and ranchers do every day.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","10:26"

"Donald Trump","They like Trump. That’s that’s great area. Thank you very much. Great job. You know, the farmers were targeted by China when we started negotiating tough with China and what I did is we’ve taken in tens of billions of dollars of tariffs. Sonny was very aware of this because he had to distribute the money to the farmers. I said, “Sonny, we’ve taken in a lot of money. How much did the farmers lose?” This is two years ago.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","11:55"
"Donald Trump","They were targeted for an amount. What do you think? The impact? He said, “$12 billion.” So I said, “That’s okay. We’ll take $12 billion out of our tariff money,” which was many billions, more than that, that China paid. Never paid us 25 cents, by the way. Before that, before Trump, they never paid anything. I said, “We’ll take 12 billion out of the tens of billions of dollars that we took in and we’re going to give it to the farmers.” And you distributed that money and Zippy, I think you were shocked because you’ve never seen anything.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","12:24"
"Donald Trump","Otherwise these farmers wouldn’t have been in business. So we took 12 million. We gave it to the farmers. We said, “Thank you very much to China. Thank you very much, China,” and then the next year I said, “Sonny, what’s the number?” We called Zippy. We called some of the other people. We determined it was $16 billion that the farmers were targeted; 16 billion by China.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","12:51"
"Donald Trump","So I took 16 billion out of the tariffs, which were many, many billions of tens of billions more than that. We gave it to the farmers, right? This year the same thing. It’s been pretty amazing and the farmers are doing fine. One of them said, “I do better this way.” But you know what? They don’t want to do better that way. They just want a level playing field but we took care of our farmers. Right? And ranchers. Thank you, Robert. That was great.

"Donald Trump","I have to say, the job you do is so powerful and so important.

"Zippy Duvall","Thank you, Mr.. President. I remember four years and several months ago, I won the election to be President of American Farm Bureau and candidate Trump called me. He says, “I’m going to be a friend to the farmer.” And Mr. President, I’m here to tell you today, thank you. You’ve lived up to those words that you made to me that day.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","17:25"
"Zippy Duvall","I represent all farmers across the country. I also farm. My son and I. I’m third generation. My son is fourth generation.

"Zippy Duvall","We grow chickens for Pilgrim Prime, about a million and a half chickens a year. And the farmers across America are very appreciative, mister president, of what you’ve done. You’ve stood behind us during a trade war. You stood behind us during all the difficulties we went through. And now with the pandemic, you stood behind us again. And you know, and you’ve made the comment, we’re the only group that comes to the White House without our hand … We don’t come with our hands out.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","18:03"

"Zippy Duvall","We want that level playing field. We want that trade. We want to be able to make our money from the markets. But we appreciate when we’re going through difficult times that you stand behind us. This pandemic has made us realize one thing. We live in land of plenty, but there’s a food chain that is just as important to us as our military is. We have to be able to feed our own people. We can’t afford to be fed by other countries, that makes us a national security issue. And we know that you realize that. And I think the American people unfortunately have had go to the store and see some empty shelves. And we all now realize how important that chain, that food chain is. And the farmer is that very first link.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","18:26"
"Zippy Duvall","Without that support, we wouldn’t be there to produce that food. Our farmers are still farming. Hashtag still farming. You’ll get some great stories. We’ve touched over 50 million people with that hashtag, talking about what farmers are doing, still farming, but we want to thank you. We want to thank Secretary Purdue for his hard work, and his staff’s done an excellent job putting this problem together, and we want to thank Congress for thinking about agriculture today and delivering it to your desk for you to sign. So many thanks for helping the people that feed the American people.

"Donald Trump","We’ve come through. Absolutely. She’s a great woman. Great woman. Thank you very much Zippy. So just to conclude, American farmers, ranchers, and growers feed fuel and sustain our nation. They’re proud defenders of the American way of life, and I’m proud to stand right by their side in this hour of need. And the food chains are now back to almost working perfectly again. They had some interruptions which you knew about, and we were able to take a very bold action, you saw that. And that action caused them to do what they had to do. And they were in good shape, and very shortly there’ll be an absolutely perfect shape, but people were worried about that. The action we took was a very important action, Larry Kudlow, wasn’t it? We did a good job. Now I’d like to ask Secretary Perdue to say a few words followed by Ivanka and Marty Smith, if I could. Okay? Please, please.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","20:06"
"Secretary Perdue","Mister president. I remember very clearly you calling me just a few weeks ago when you read about the effects of the pandemic own American agriculture. And once again you directed me, Sonny, we’re going to have to help our farmers. Bring me a program. What’s it going to take? I want you to use all the available resources at your disposal, just as you’ve done before, when China retaliated against our farmers there. I don’t know how, mister president, but you instinctively know that American agriculture, farmers and ranchers have been the bedrock of our American economy since the founding of our nation and still are. And we talked about the food supply chain, you know that instinctively, but I want to tell you, I’ve never, in my lifetime, seen another president recognized that value among the folks standing here and representing farmers and ranchers all across the country.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","21:02"
"Secretary Perdue","So we’re very appreciative at USDA that we don’t have to push the rock up the hill. Usually when it comes to President Trump, the rock’s coming down the hill, I have to catch it. And we appreciate that very much that we don’t have to sell you on the value of agriculture, but the program that we’re announcing today will be a benefit. The $16 million of direct farmer, direct payments to farmers of all sizes and really all production there will be very helpful. A real lifeline, but certainly the program that Ivanka and I were privileged to go out last Friday, the coastal produce that you see here is also a lifeline, not only to those specialty crop producers, both dairy producers and meat producers, but also to the families who need this food.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","21:54"
"Secretary Perdue","So you can see this is high quality food here that is being distributed all across the country to our food banks, and really a lifeline for them as well. So the food supply chain begins with these producers representing farmers and branches all across the country, ending up in the families tables that need this food is a real noble profession. I’m honored to be a part of it. And I’m really particularly honored, President Trump, that you understand, just in your heart, how valuable our American agricultural sector is. And I thank you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","22:40"
"Donald Trump","Thank you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","23:10"
"Ivanka Trump","Thank you, secretary. This is an incredibly exciting day as this very large relief package is announced. And you can hear today and you can hear through the course of the campaign in the last three years, the special place all of you have in the heart of this president. Farmers and ranchers feed America. And that’s never been more true than we’ve all realized over the course of the last several months. In addition to the much needed relief, the $16 billion that will go to farmers and ranchers to help support them through this difficult time. This farmers to family food box program is just an amazing initiative. As the secretary mentioned, the saw that there were those in need, those vulnerable. Long lines at food banks trying to get food. And yet there was this unbelievable, beautiful American fresh produce that was going to waste.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","23:15"
"Ivanka Trump","So thinking about that supply chain and ensuring with $3 billion, that those who are vulnerable, that those who are in need get access to boxes like these 20 to 25 pounds of meat, milk, all forms of dairy, and of course, great fresh produce is incredibly virtuous. It’s a great cycle. It helps the small distributors. It helps the small farmers who weren’t prioritized in the bids. And of course it helps those in need. So we’re very excited about this program. These boxes themselves will also be going to a mission here in DC, along with several others that we have at the White House. And we hope that these boxes will play a big role in feeding those who needed across the country. So thank you. And thank you secretary for the hard work of your team in standing up this program so rapidly. We think that it will be extraordinarily successful for our small farmers and, of course, those in need, so thank you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","24:09"

"Marty Smith","Thank you, mister president. You have provided unprecedented leadership to the United States and to the world throughout this crisis. And with that, you have shown so much concern and so much support for American agriculture, and on behalf of the National Cattleman’s Beef Association and the rest of agriculture, I want to say thank you. I’m Marty Smith. And I’m a rancher from Florida and serving this year as president of the National Cattleman’s Beef Association. Your executive order a few weeks ago directed toward the packers. We’re starting to see the impact of that. We’re getting beef pork back online and getting the products back on the shelf. America’s farmers and ranchers continue to work around the clock to feed the public, to feed all of our notion, feed a large part of the world. What you’ve done with that and what we’re doing with this current program enables us to stay in business and continue to do that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","25:15"
"Marty Smith","Again, we thank you for that. We thank your administration. Working with Secretary Perdue has just been a great way for us to all move forward. Even more importantly than that, I want to thank you and your family. With us, it’s all about our families and our family operation. Your family is just as dedicated to this, and Ivanka, we thank you for the support. You’ve shown them to us. It’s just … It’s so meaningful. And together we get through this and we do beat this and we keep the highest quality, safest, most sustainable protein sources on the plate of Americans all through this.

"Speaker 7","Mr. President, how is your administration addressing the comorbidities that Secretary Azar said are responsible for a lot of the coronavirus deaths: Obesity, hypertension, diabetes, obviously very closely connected to our food supply.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","27:49"
"Donald Trump","Well, I think we just want people in this country to be healthy. How does every country address it? We want our people to be healthy. We want them to be happy and we want them to have all of the benefits that you could have including great healthcare. The Republican party has been very strong on healthcare, as you know, and that includes preexisting conditions. And we have done a terrific job on healthcare. Then we got hit by a plague like nobody’s ever seen before, outside of maybe 1917. And I think we’ve done an incredible job in producing ventilators and producing testing. Right now, you probably saw the numbers were over 12 million tests. That’s three times more, four times more than any other country in the world. And we’re talking about countries that have done a good job. Nobody’s done testing like us. Plus we have the highest quality test. So very simply we want our people to be healthy.

"Speaker 7","But the diabetes, hypertension, and obesity specifically, that’s very closely connected to the food supply. How are you addressing those? Specifically, your own health and human services secretary said that’s why America has so many COVID deaths.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","28:53"
"Donald Trump","Sure, we want to give people great food. And that’s one of the reasons we have our farmers and ranchers involved.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","29:03"
"Speaker 8","Could you talk a little bit more about this problem. You say it’s a problem with importing cattle from other countries. What is the problem there?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","29:08"
"Donald Trump","Well, it’s a relatively small number. Actually, I heard Sonny speaking about it yesterday. It’s a very small number, but it’s still cattle coming in. We have tremendous amounts of supply cattle and all, but generally speaking, supply. Tremendous supply, our farmers have done an incredible job. And now the distribution is being made much better than it has been and better. I think it will end up being much better than it’s ever been, [Zippy. 00:00:29:38].","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","29:14"
"Donald Trump","But I’m saying, why are we bringing in cattle? All trade deals that were made a long time ago, why are we bringing in cattle from other countries when we have so much ourselves? Now, in some cases, I thought your answer was very good. They’ve been great allies. They’ve been working with us for many years. Sometimes we needed the cattle and sometimes we don’t. That’s the farming business, but I would say generally speaking, unless this is a country that really has been with us, we shouldn’t be taking their cattle. You know that. Okay? And that’s the way we’re going to handle it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","29:38"

"Donald Trump","I don’t want to go through it. The letter is a very detailed, long letter. But basically they have to clean up their act. They have to do a better job. They have to be much more fair to other countries, including the United States. So we’re not going to be involved with them anymore. We’ll do in a separate way. Okay?

"Speaker 9","Some workers at meat packing plants, it’s like they’re still concerned about their safety and that they want the government to do more to enforce and make sure that meat packing companies are keeping their workers safe with protective equipment, testing, et cetera. Is there any more that you plan to do to make sure and enforce that meat packing companies are keeping their workers safe?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-supporting-farmers-ranchers-may-19","Donald Trump Speech Transcript Supporting Farmers & Ranchers May 19","30:33"
"Donald Trump","I’ve been very much involved with plants since this problem came up and they’ve done a lot in terms of shields and other things, but they had a disproportionately high number of people that had the problem and that’s going away. The plants are very, very clean now. And they’re getting to a level where I think we had a report that they’re cleaner than they’ve ever been. That’s a good report, but I don’t know exactly what that means, but they are cleaner than they’ve ever been. They’re doing a very good job, I think, right now in terms of the Production Act and in terms of what we’re enforcing. But the meat packing plants are coming online. Many of them are online and fewer and fewer problems and being seen. If we didn’t act, we would have had a big problem. If somebody who was in this position, that didn’t act, we would have had a big problem, but it’s something that we were very much involved in because we saw it very early. Okay.

And we’re dealing on that subject. And we’re also, on the Southern border, as you know, the wall is going up, it’s going up very rapidly. We’re at 182 miles. Wherever we have the wall, it’s just ended. It just ended people coming into our country illegally. We’re stopping drug traffic, we’re stopping trafficking and people, mostly women, because they traffic mostly women, unfortunately. It’s a tremendously big business. It’s a horrible business and we’re stopping it. It’s a worldwide problem. This isn’t a problem for our southern border, but our southern border is a big point. And we’re stopping trafficking. The wall has had an incredible power and strength on what we’re doing. I have to say that, so we’ll have by pretty early next year, we’ll have 450 to 500 miles of wall fully built.

I think we’re going to have a fantastic year next year. I think we will do very well in the fourth quarter. And I think the transition quarter, which is coming up, we’re starting at very shortly, the third quarter. I think you’ll see some very good numbers, but you’re going to see some great numbers in the fourth quarter. And you’re going to end up doing a great year next year. You can see it. Look at the states that are opening up. They’re busy and their numbers, interestingly, going down. So they’re opening up. You look at Florida and Georgia in particular, their numbers are going down. So, we’re very confident that we’re going to have a tremendous, tremendous turnaround.
