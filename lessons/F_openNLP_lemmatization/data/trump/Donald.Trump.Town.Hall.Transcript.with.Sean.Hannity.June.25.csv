"Sean Hannity","And now, here’s my town hall that we taped earlier today from an airplane hangar in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Now, by the way, we followed all the rules and recommendations of the county in which we’re doing this. So as to have as many people as they recommended, small crowd, but an enthusiastic group of people. Obviously, because of all that we’ve been dealing with COVID-19, we had a lot of ground to cover tonight. Watch this. Thank you, Mr. President. Thanks for joining us. We’re going to take some audience questions throughout the hour. You’re here in Wisconsin, one of the things that everybody’s looking for and we’ll get into more detail throughout the hour is the economy, you are going to leave this town hall, and you’re going to announce that you’re building 20 new ships. You rebuilding the military and how many jobs?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","00:00"
"Donald Trump","Well, it’s going to be probably 6,000, 7,000 jobs, could go up to 10 in Wisconsin alone. And it’s a great shipyard that was on hard times. And now it’s a very good shipyard and a lot of people are going to be working. And it’s one of the most beautiful ships. It looks like a yacht with a lot of ammunition on it, I will tell you. It’s really something. And we’ll probably end up with 20 or 25. And these are big ones, beautiful ships. And they do a beautiful job in Wisconsin. So I’m here, it’s sort of like a launch. We’re starting work and the contract’s all given and you won it right here, so congratulations folks.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","00:48"
"Sean Hannity","We as a nation, we’ve been watching, it was universal agreement that what happened to George Floyd should never happen, can never happen again. And you’ve been very outspoken about it as well. And they were peaceful protestors, but then there were people rioting. We see anarchy, we see rocks and bottles and bricks and Molotov cocktails thrown at police officers, police precincts burn to the ground. In Seattle, an autonomous zone that still remains, is changing apparently today but taken over, including a police precinct. And you’re offering all of these states help, New York, Illinois, and Washington. What are they telling you when you offer them help?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","01:27"
"Donald Trump","Well, first of all, we have arrested, I think almost, but it could be over the number, hundreds of people. We have arrested a lot of people for what they’ve done. They’ve created bedlam. They’ve destroyed very important things. I mean, you’re also talking about statues of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln. They’d like to get Jesus, you know that, right? They said, “We want to get Jesus.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","02:07"

"Donald Trump","These have nothing to do with any particular event, other than they’re troublemakers or agitators. And they’re anarchists. The big thing they want is they want to really destabilize our country and we don’t let them. So I said to my people, “If you’ve arrested so many, how come we don’t know about it?” They said, “We don’t talk about it, sir, we do it.” But I said, “I think the public should know it.” And we have a statues act, a monument act, which puts you in jail for 10 years if you do what they’ve done. So we’ve got that. We’ve got all the tapes because the nice part is it’s all on television. Like the character on the horse the other day, he’s up there putting on the ropes. He’s in trouble, on the Andrew Jackson … beautiful, it’s beautiful, right opposite the White House.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","02:30"
"Donald Trump","And you got to remember Andrew Jackson, the Battle of New Orleans and so much. He was a very good president. He was a great general and you can’t let that happen. But they’re after Abraham Lincoln and tonight, I guess they’re looking at Abraham Lincoln and that was the Emancipation Proclamation. So you have that and you’re signing Emancipation Proclamation and you have somebody, I think that wasn’t freed, and he’s getting up. It’s the position of, he’s getting up. He’s being freed by Abraham Lincoln. And I can see controversy, but I can also see beauty in it. And it was paid for by slaves. I don’t know if you know that, it was paid for because they were so grateful to the president.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","03:09"
"Donald Trump","It was paid for that reason and they want to take it down. And we can take things down too, I can understand certain things being taken down. But they ought to go through a process legally and then we take it down. In some cases, put them in museums or wherever they may go. But these are really rioters and they’re a lot of bad people involved. They talk about protestors and they’re protestors, but there are beyond protesters too, and we’re not going to allow it. So we have many, many people under arrest and we have some just from the other night in Washington, but I’m talking about in other states also.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","03:51"

"Donald Trump","Excuse me, by the way, and Washington is not D.C., not a state. Because if I say that, a little statement like that, sometimes I’ll say, should I correct myself? Because the fake news will say, “He thought D.C. was a state.” So I just want to make that clear so they can’t do it, okay.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","04:28"

"Sean Hannity","Let’s talk about these states though. You see your old city, you’re now a Florida resident. You’re going to save a lot of money on taxes. There’s no state income tax in Florida, but you see New York City, 350% increase. You see in Chicago last weekend, 102 of our fellow citizens were shot. 12 were children and 14 died. The carnage existed all throughout these years that Joe Biden was vice president. Barack was president. I don’t know any reforms that they put in place after Ferguson or after Baltimore or many other incidents.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","04:48"

"Donald Trump","What’s happening is a disgrace. This is a corrupt situation. We caught them spying on my campaign. They were spying. I said that a long time ago, remember, but I said it without great knowledge. It turned out to be correct. They were spying on my campaign. And if that were the other way around, if it was switched with Democrat and Republican, the opposite way, you’d have people in jail for 50 years for they did because that’s treason. That’s a terrible thing what they did. And what they’ve done to people like General Flynn and like others is disgraceful, it’s disgraceful.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","05:34"

"Sean Hannity","They barely mentioned it in eight years. You see Seattle, you see New York City. We see now people dying in the autonomous zone.

"Donald Trump","You can’t, you can’t. Look, Chicago’s an example. It’s like worse than Afghanistan. It’s worse than, I shouldn’t say because they’re working with us, Honduras, Guatemala, they’re all working with us now. You know, we have our lowest numbers. We have phenomenal numbers on the border. Border patrol has done a great job. We built 220 miles of wall. It’s going up very rapidly. We should be doing about 10 miles a week now. And we’re going to have … it will be completed very soon. But what we’ve done there is incredible. But you look at Honduras, Guatemala, all of these different places. We have cities that are worse. In some cases, far worse. Take a look at Detroit, take a look at what’s happening in Oakland. Take a look at what’s happening in Baltimore. And everyone gets upset when I say it, they say, “Oh, is that a racist statement?” It’s not a racist.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","06:45"

"Donald Trump","If I’ve ever seen a case, I know it’s very controversial to say stop and frisk, okay. Stop and frisk, you take guns away. Chicago is the greatest example I think I’ve ever seen of that. Rudy Giuliani was a great mayor, he did it in New York. He started it and it worked great. Bloomberg blew it because he went crazy with it. And ultimately it took away a lot of rights and a lot of, it wasn’t a good job he did.

"Sean Hannity","The murder rate went, for those that don’t know, I lived in New York City at the time, went from around 2,500 a year, they drove it all the way down to 500.

"Donald Trump","Could stop it quickly. And at some point in the not too distant future, I’m going to do it. And if they don’t do something with Seattle, we’re going to do that. We’re going to go in there because what’s happening, they’re taking over American cities. By the way, in all cases, it’s Democrats, they’re Democrat run, in all cases. And Joe Biden would have that be the whole country. It’s so crazy what’s happening. Here’s a guy, doesn’t talk. Nobody hears him. Whenever he does talk, he can’t put two sentences together. I don’t want to be nice or un-nice, okay. But I mean, the man can’t speak and he’s going to be your president because some people don’t love me maybe and all I’m doing is doing my job. Don’t forget, before the China plague came in and it’s the China plague, before that came in, we had the best job numbers we’ve ever had.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","08:55"

And in NASDAQ, it’s actually beat those numbers. But we have the best numbers we’ve ever had. African American, Asian American, Hispanic American, women, young people without a diploma, young people with a diploma, college, everything, everything. We had the best numbers we’ve ever had, the best economy we’ve ever had. I was absolutely doing a number on China. Not that I want to, but we’re taking billions and billions away. China ran away from us when we had … they were going to take over our country. If I didn’t come along, they would have taken over our country. What they did to Obama and Biden, they ripped off this country, hundreds of billions of dollars a year, going into China. And nobody said anything.

I said, “How did it happen?” They said, “Nobody ever asked.” Nobody said, we’ve got to make a deal. We’re taking in hundreds of billions of dollars worth of tariffs.

Now, you have a big percentage of that, but other countries do very few tests. So, it shows very few cases.

"Donald Trump","And especially Black and Hispanic. It’s so unfair. And I said, “Why wasn’t this done before?” Now, Obama didn’t try. If he did, he may come out and say, “We did try,” but he didn’t get it done. I got it done. People said, “You wouldn’t be able to get it done.” I got it done with the help of some very good Republicans that frankly … they could have gone either way on it, to be honest. Although we had some very strong conservative Republicans, like Mike Lee. Republicans that wanted it very much. Chuck Grassley. Some great, strong conservative Republicans that wanted it very much.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","16:16"
"Donald Trump","It was both ways. Very unusual. You had some very strong conservatives, and you also had some really, really liberal people. But we did criminal justice reform. Nobody thought it was possible to get it done. I got it done. They couldn’t get it done. Then they’ll say such horrible things. I mean, on the campaign they’ll say such horrible things about me. It’s a very unfair business. But it’s a great ad for them. “I got beaten by China.” Wrong. I beat China very badly.

"Donald Trump","That’s right. That’s right. It’s a way of looking at it. I’ll tell you. Now, nobody’s ever seen anything like that. But what they’ll do is they’ll take five or six points, and just say I lost. If you look at what we’ve done on ventilators, on testing, again, where we have 30 million … Germany is second with maybe 4, maybe 5 million. Germany is going to show fewer cases because they’re testing far fewer people. Different sized countries and all, but they’re testing far fewer people. But many countries don’t do testing like that, so it shows we’re way up in testing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","17:31"
"Donald Trump","But what it also shows by doing that … in all fairness, it shows a very, very low mortality rate. Just about the lowest. We’re right at the bottom in a positive way. I think that people are starting to see it. But if I don’t do a show like this, which is live or semi-live … If I don’t do a show like this, we’re not going to get the word out. Because the press is really corrupt and dishonest. I can’t believe it. I used to say, “Fake news. Fake news.” It’s much worse than fake news. And it’s not only what they say.

"Sean Hannity","I’ve devoted almost three years to unpeeling every layer of the onion. In fact, what we now know is that there was that Jack Flynn was exonerated. The case was going to be closed. Then Joe Biden brought up the Logan Act, which you mentioned earlier, 1799 law nobody’s ever been prosecuted for. Now, not only was it that. We’ve now learned that there was premeditated fraud on a FISA Court to spy on you as a candidate, you and your transition team, and deep into your presidency. James Comey signed three of the four warrants, but he came to you after he signed the first one in Trump Tower and said … well, again, now we know the bulk of information was Hillary’s dirty Russian disinformation document.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","18:46"

What they did to that man … what they did to Paul Manafort. Roger Stone, what they’ve done to Roger Stone because he knew me … he wasn’t on the campaign except the very, very beginning. What they did with Roger Stone, what they did to General Flynn. Then how about Papadopoulos? I didn’t know Papadopoulos. But what they put him through.

You start calling up because you want to coordinate between countries, and the tape was … as you said, with the Russia, with the Ukrainian situation. It was a perfect tape. It was a perfect conversation that he had. What they’ve done to General Flynn … who’s a nice man, tough guy, smart guy, a great general.

Could it be North Korea?” I said, “No, it’s the United States of America. The toughest country to deal with.” Because we have Schumer, and Pelosi, and people that are bad people that I honestly believe don’t love our country. What they do to our country, and what they’ve done with this scam … the whole scam. Flynn is a piece of it. The Mueller scam. Now, it came out that Mueller should have announced in the first week that we did nothing wrong. In other words, they had evidence in the first few days that there was no collusion with Russia. There was nothing to do with Russia. They knew that immediately.

Totally destroyed his life. What they’ve done to Roger Stone is incredible. And the jury forewoman stands out. And to at least not give him a new trial is inconceivable. And by the way, she was a dominant person. The jurors said she was very dominating in the room. She dominated. He got a tremendously big sentence.

"Donald Trump","So a lot of people think it’s the fact that we will have, I think before I’m finished this term, we’ll have close to 300 federal judges. A lot of people think… Because that’s a record. That’s a number that nobody can even believe. And part of it was that President Obama was unable to get judges approved in a large number, about 142 judges. So I took it off, got them approved, and then got a lot approved beyond. So we’ll be close to 302 Supreme Court judges, great ones. And so I think a lot of people would say that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","26:37"
"Donald Trump","I think one of them, though, is our military. We have Space Force, which we’ve added after 76 years, we’ve added a new branch of the military. It’s a big deal, a very important deal, because space is going to be very important. It already is. I would say the rebuilding of the military and the taking care of our vets. We had a 91% joint approval rating the other day. The VA. The VA was a disaster. All of my life, I’ve seen these horror stories. I don’t want to really jinx it, because they’ll go around and find somebody that’s unhappy. But you don’t see that anymore. And our administrator, our secretary, has done a fantastic job. And we’re 91% approval rating with the VA.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","27:07"
"Donald Trump","And we got Veterans Choice approved and Veterans Accountability. That’s where you can fire people that do a bad job. You couldn’t do it before. Very hard to get. They tried to get it for 50 years. Because of civil service unions, et cetera, you couldn’t get it. I got it. And the other thing is Veterans Choice, where if they can’t see a doctor, we have great doctors in the VA. But if you can’t see a doctor, you go out and you get a private doctor, we pay the bill. You have no idea how great it’s been. And it’s actually, you save money, believe it or not. But you have no idea. We save lives, tremendous number of lives. And I would say that’s an achievement.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","27:47"
"Donald Trump","But we’ve done a lot. The largest tax cuts ever, the largest regular… If you look at our regulation cut, Sean, more than any other administration in history, whether it’s eight years or in one case, more than that, we cut regulations. And we we still have a lot more we’re going to be cutting over the next month and a half, two months. So we’ve done a lot and we’re very proud of it. And we had the best, until this artificial problem, because I call it an artificial problem. We had to turn off our country to save millions of lives, and now we’ve turned it back on, and it’s coming back much faster than anybody thought possible. So we’ve done a lot of things.

You can do something good and they can make it sound beyond belief bad, like it’s the worst thing ever. And I said it a little bit before, you can do something great and it doesn’t get reported.

The second one was about the same thing. They impeached a President of the United States. Now, in all fairness, the Republican Party was great, because they got 196 to nothing Republican votes in the House, and 52 1/2 to 1/2, Romney. Romney. Half of a… I call it 52 1/2 to 1/2, because he had two votes and one was yes. But we did. They were great. The Republican Party was great. They were steadfast because they knew it was a hoax.

"Donald Trump","And it was a shame. The person they beat up was a Democrat who happened to be gay. He was probably out there rooting them on or something, because Democrats think it’s wonderful that they’re destroying our country. It’s a very sick thing going on. Nobody’s ever seen it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","33:03"
"Donald Trump","Biden is going to be… Look, I don’t think Biden’s a radical left, but it doesn’t matter, because they’re going to just do whatever they want to do. They’ll take him over. He can’t perform. He’s not going to be able to perform. He’s shot. He’s shot. Whether you like it or not, he’s shot. The radical left is going to take him over. Look what happened. Eliot Engel was a pretty main line guy. He lost by like 37 points or so. He just got killed in the election we just had yesterday.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","33:16"
"Donald Trump","He was supposed to be a shoo-in, and he got hit by a strong far left candidate. You have a couple of other Congressmen and women that probably are going to lose, or are going to lose, very close. Too close to call. Look at what’s happened to the Democrats, and these are real lefties. These are people that… Take a look at Venezuela. Venezuela was a very rich country, a great country, a beacon 20 years ago, 15 years ago. People looked… Richest country in Latin South America. Richest, everything good. They don’t have food. They don’t have water. They have death all over. People have nothing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","33:45"
"Donald Trump","It’s the same exact mindset and philosophy that we have today on attack, and it won’t happen. Not while I’m here, it won’t happen. But a guy like Biden, he’s going to have no power to do anything about it. And they’re dragging him. I don’t know if you saw, Bernie Sanders said, “My sole focus now is to take Joe Biden way left.” They’re going to do it, because there’s nobody in the center left. He was left anyway, but there’s nobody in the center or center left.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","34:27"
"Donald Trump","I mean, it’s a disgrace what’s happened to our country. Now, with that being said, the Republicans have to get tougher. And I’m telling them all the time, because they’re sitting back, they want to be politically correct. They think, “Oh, it’s terrible to say something bad.” No, no, no. I told them. You’ll see, if anyone attacks… I stopped it the other night, I stopped it a number of times, but you’ll see what’s happening. We told him, every night we’re going to get tougher and tougher. At some point, there’s going to be retribution, because there has to be. These people have vandals, but they’re agitators, but they’re really terrorists, in a sense.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","34:56"
"Donald Trump","So I think you’ll be extremely impressed, but you have to put pressure. Also, I love the Republicans. I told you, they came from me a hundred percent. I’m at 96% approval rating in the Republican party. But I said, “You’re going to have to get tougher. You can’t be politically correct anymore, because we’re really fighting something that’s very dangerous.” Thank you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","35:33"

"Sean Hannity","Let’s talk about a second term. If you hear in 131 days from now, at some point in the night or early morning, we can now project Donald J. Trump has been reelected the 45th president of the United States. Let’s talk. What’s at stake in this election as you compare and contrast, and what is one of your top priority items for a second term?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","35:55"
"Donald Trump","Well, one of the things that will be really great… You know, the word experience is still good. I always say talent is more important than experience. I’ve always said that, but the word experience is a very important word. It’s a very important meeting. I never did this before. I never slept over in Washington. I was in Washington, I think, 17 times. All of a sudden, I’m president of the United States. You know the story. I’m riding down Pennsylvania Avenue with our First Lady and I say, “This is great.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","36:17"
"Donald Trump","But I didn’t know very many people in Washington, it wasn’t my thing. I was from Manhattan from New York. Now I know everybody, and I have great people in the administration. You make some mistakes. An idiot like Bolton, all he wanted to do is drop bombs on everybody. You don’t have to drop bums on everybody. You don’t have to kill people.

"Donald Trump","Yeah. Oh, absolutely. Well, he did release classified. Actually, he had a… A judge said that they released the book early, so he couldn’t do it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","37:06"

"Donald Trump","But he said, “This is very dangerous, what you’ve done for yourself. And also, any money that you’ve made, good luck.” This was a very powerful opinion that we had. No. He’s sort of a sick guy. There’s something wrong with him. But I noticed that earlier, he made two very bad mistakes. He made a mistake where he talked about the Libyan model. I won’t go to explain that, but some of you understand, he was on Deface the Nation. And he talked about the Libyan model. I said, “That’s a disaster,” because you know why.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","37:14"
"Donald Trump","And the other thing he said, “Going into Iraq was a good thing.” I said, “Okay, John, but now you know it wasn’t, right?” “No, no. I still think it was.” I said, “So we’re in for $8 trillion in the Middle East, and you think that was a good thing?” And I’m pulling out, you know, I’ve getting everybody out nice and easy. Everyone’s going nicely. Going nicely. “You think it was good to go into Iraq, go into the Middle East?”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","37:45"
"Donald Trump","“Yes.” So those two things happened early in his little period of time. He was only there a short while. Once he said those two things, I no longer paid much attention to him, if any. But I’ll tell you, he was good for one thing. Everyone thought he was crazy, because all he wants to do is bomb people. You know, he’ll fight Russia. Let’s fight Russia. Let’s fight China. Let’s take them on at the same time. He’s crazy. When I walked into a room with him, I knew that. When they saw Bolton, they always gave me what I wanted, because they said, “Trump’s going to drop bombs on me. He’s got this maniac with him.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","38:10"
"Donald Trump","So in a way, he helped me in terms of a negotiation. But seriously, he didn’t do a good job. He wasn’t smart. He wasn’t sharp. And he’s the only man I think I’ve ever met… I knew him for a year, one year, whatever the time was, short time. I don’t think I ever saw him smile once. I said to him once, “John, do you have a smile?” And it tells you something about somebody.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","38:42"

"Mark","The big concern I’ve got is, how are you going to make sure that the election is fair and free from fraudulent “absentee votes” and mail-in ballots? That’s the concern I’ve got.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","40:13"
"Donald Trump","I think it’s the most important question I’ll be asked, because it’s a great question. Now we have a mail-in thing. As you see California, he’s sending out millions and millions of ballots. Where are they going? Where aren’t they going? Is the postman going to hand them out? Are they going to take them out of the mailboxes?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","40:25"
"Donald Trump","The other thing, Mark, it’s very important. You get to foreign countries. You know, they keep talking, oh, Russia, China, this. Especially China, not Russia, especially China. Are they going to print millions of ballots using the exact same paper, using the exact same machines, and are they going to print ballots, and then hand them in? And all of a sudden, it’s the biggest risk we have: the mail-in ballot. Not so much the absentee ballot, because an absentee, like I’m in the White House, and I have to vote in Florida, et cetera, et cetera. You’re absentee, it’s okay.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","40:42"
"Donald Trump","But people go through a process for that. You know, it’s really pretty good. But the mail-in ballots, they mail them to anybody, and they send them out by the millions. I think I read over 30 million ballots are going to be sent out in California. Where are they going? Nobody’s standing there watching you vote. At least the other way, you get in line, and they’re using… You know, I said the other day. We went through World War I and we voted. We went through World War II and we voted, and now we have a virus. By that time, it’ll be less and less. Why aren’t we going to vote? People want to vote, but it would be nice to be able to see the people. On top of that, they should have ID voting.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-town-hall-transcript-with-sean-hannity-june-25","Donald Trump Town Hall Transcript with Sean Hannity June 25","41:14"

"Donald Trump","Yeah, I guess the three is the minimum. Now, he’s already saying that he can’t do the debates because of COVID. You believe it? “I can’t do the debates because of COVID.” I just heard a little inkling of it two days ago. I said, “Watch this one.” Now, I will do any amount of debates. You understand what I mean? If I say, “I want to do 10 debates,” they’ll say, “Oh, he’s afraid.
