"President Donald Trump","So we’re going to Charlotte, the Charlotte area, we’ll be talking about healthcare. We have a lot of good things happening with respect to health care and very positive on pre-existing conditions. Very positive on the fact that we got rid of the individual mandate, which is the single most unpopular thing having to do with Obamacare, the Obamacare disaster. But we have a lot of incredible things, positive things, and very good things and money saving things on healthcare. Then we’re going to Florida. We have a big rally and it’ll be something. I hear there’s a tremendous number of people. So we’re not totally surprised by that, but that’s okay. Tremendous number of people. Jennifer, go ahead.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-remarks-at-joint-base-andrews-transcript-september-24","Donald Trump Remarks Transcript September 24","00:00"

"President Donald Trump","They’re working to see if they can make a deal. And if they make a deal, they’ll have to bring it to me and I’ll either approve it or not. To me, safety is the predominant factor and we’ll see if they can do that. But they’re moving along and let’s see what happens. If they make a deal, that’s fine. And if they don’t, that’s okay too.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-remarks-at-joint-base-andrews-transcript-september-24","Donald Trump Remarks Transcript September 24","00:54"

"President Donald Trump","So we have to be very careful with the ballots. The ballots, that’s a whole big scam. They found, I understand, eight ballots in a wastepaper basket in some location they found it. It was reported in one of the newspapers that they found a lot of ballots in a river. They throw them out if they have the name Trump on it, I guess. But they had ballots.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-remarks-at-joint-base-andrews-transcript-september-24","Donald Trump Remarks Transcript September 24","01:16"
"Speaker 3","They had no names on them, they said.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-remarks-at-joint-base-andrews-transcript-september-24","Donald Trump Remarks Transcript September 24","01:37"
"President Donald Trump","Okay, well, they still found them in a river, whether they had a name on it or not. But the other ones had the Trump name on it and they were thrown into a wastepaper basket. We want to make sure the election is honest and I’m not sure that it can be. I don’t know that it can be with this whole situation. Unsolicited ballots, they’re unsolicited. Millions being sent to everybody. And we’ll see. But if you remember, Hillary Clinton just a week ago or so told Joe Biden, “Do not accept the results of the election under any circumstances.” But you don’t ask her that question. You only ask me the question.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-remarks-at-joint-base-andrews-transcript-september-24","Donald Trump Remarks Transcript September 24","01:38"

"President Donald Trump","I don’t want to make a comment on that, but we’re going to make our decision on Saturday. But I won’t comment on that. I will say this, I think Saturday afternoon, five o’clock, it’s going to be a very important day in the history of our country. I think it’s going to be a very monumental, very good choice.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-remarks-at-joint-base-andrews-transcript-september-24","Donald Trump Remarks Transcript September 24","02:25"

"President Donald Trump","Well, we have numerous companies. We have Johnson & Johnson. We have Pfizer. We have Moderna. We have others too. They’re great companies, the best in the world. So I think you’d put the people of New York at great risk. And he’s done that, if you look at the nursing homes. 11,000 people died needlessly. So when you look at that, it’s very sad. So we’ll see. He’ll have to see. But these are great companies. These are being done by, really, probably, some of the greatest companies in the world, when you think, with Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, et cetera. I think that they are getting very close. As you know, they’re in final testing right now. Phase three, but final. They’ve given shots to everybody, to a lot, thousands and thousands of people. And so far it looks very good and it looks like it could happen fairly quickly.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-remarks-at-joint-base-andrews-transcript-september-24","Donald Trump Remarks Transcript September 24","03:06"

"President Donald Trump","I think it’s a sad thing. And I give my regards to the family of Breonna. I also think it’s so sad what’s happening with everything about that case, including law enforcement. So many people suffering, so many people needlessly suffering. But with respect to Breonna, we give our regards to the family.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-remarks-at-joint-base-andrews-transcript-september-24","Donald Trump Remarks Transcript September 24","04:02"

"President Donald Trump","Well, it was an honor to be a nominated for two Nobel Prizes. So that was an honor, and we’ll see what’s happening.

"President Donald Trump","Well, I think that was just a political chant. We could hardly hear it from where we were. Somebody said there was some chanting, but they were right next to the media. But we really could hardly hear too much.

"President Donald Trump","Well, we’re speaking with a lot of people about that. I’m doing very well in Maine. You’ve seen the numbers. What I’ve done for Maine is what nobody’s done. I’ve freed up 5,000 square miles of ocean that was taken away by President Obama. And for the lobster, the people that go out and get us those great lobsters that we all like so much, I freed that whole business up and the fishermen too. We freed it up. So I think I’ve done more for Maine than just about anybody, certainly, in many, many years. So I’m doing very well in Maine. I don’t know. I haven’t seen polls on Susan. But I hope she does well.
