You’re going to see that on the third, although the Supreme Court would probably like to delay it for a long time it looks like, but we’re going to have a tremendous victory. It’s going to be a victory like none other. It’s the most election of our lives. Hello, Michigan. How are you doing, Michigan? How are you doing? It’s cold, but I feel very warm in this group. This a great group. Four days from now, we are going to win this state and we are going on to win four more great years in the White House. We’re going to have it. We’re going to have it. Unless there’s something that we don’t see. I’m watching these Biden rallies. It’s like there’s nobody. Of course, he says that they want to do it that way on purpose. The problem is nobody shows up. They were putting on the screen our rally, that’s you, you’re all famous, very famous. And his rally, there was nobody. At least he’s doing a rally. He got out of the basement so that’s good.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-waterford-township-michigan-october-30","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Waterford Township, Michigan October 30","02:29"

We’re going to take care of our doctors and frontline workers, everybody. And by the way, without it, we’re still rounding the corner. We have it, but without it, we round the corner and it will be available free. We’re doing the vaccine free. And the reason is that this wasn’t your fault. This wasn’t anyone’s fault.

No, he said, “A long, dark winter.” Oh, that’s great. That’s wonderful. That’s just what our country needs is a long, dark winter and a leader that talks about it. I didn’t have the privilege of going to my basement in the White House.

Now it’s different. Because it’s me they say, “I’m good for four months.” Okay? They brought it down from lifetime to four months, but that’s okay. I’ll take it. But you know what?

We had 160 million people employed. We were never even close to that number. And then one day we saved two million lives. We had to close it up. How about that decision? Oh, how horrible to have to make it. We understood the disease. We learned the disease. We have to protect our seniors, especially if they have problems with the heart or diabetes.

But 33.1, the biggest number in our country’s history by like double, but it’s much more than double. And you’d have to go back to 1952 to get anywhere close, but you know what close is? About a 17-point spread. This election is a matter of economic survival for Michigan because Joe Biden. Look at what they did during their eight years.

I just hate to use the D word. Let me just tell you something. How good have I done in bringing car companies here to Michigan? You went 42 years without a car plant.

You haven’t had that ever. And then Biden. And remember this, I only ran because of Biden and Obama. If they did a good job, I wouldn’t have run. And I guess I wouldn’t have won either, but I wouldn’t have run. They did a lousy job. I watched them now. “I’m going to do this. I’m going to do that.” What the hell didn’t he do it?

That was so easy that debate because he hit me with, “I am going to do this.” And I just kept saying, Joe, “Why didn’t you do it?” And it was three and a half years ago. It wasn’t like a long time. It was three and a half years ago. Biden has vowed to abolish the entire US energy industry, right? No fracking. Guy went for a year and a half. No fracking, no fracking and then he goes to Pennsylvania. “Of course, we’re going to frack.” And the press, the fake news never asks him about it.

You never thought you’d see that. Biden’s running made America’s most liberal Senator. She makes Bernie look like a conservative. Crazy Bernie is like a conservative compared to her.

And let’s face it, he’s shot. Do you agree with that? I can say that. I’m not a fan of his, never was. He was never known as the smart one in the Senate. He was a touchy-feely guy, a little personality. He had a good personality. Now the personality’s gone and a lot of other things are gone. He’ll deliver poverty, misery, depression. I will deliver jobs, jobs, jobs, good ones too. Yesterday it was announced that last quarter when our economy, you know when this was announced, it was a tremendous announcement. The problem with it was that we didn’t get the kind of coverage that we should’ve. So in the history, think of it, in the history of our country, GDP went up to 33.1 in the history. And it was hardly mentioned. It’s amazing.. a friend of mine, very smart said to me, “Oh, they won’t talk about it.” It’s never been done before, right? “They won’t talk about it because they don’t want you to win because they’re sick and they’re corrupt.

But if Biden wins, the recovery will end and a long economic nightmare. Just like he said on the debate, “You’re going to have a dark winter.” That was really depressing. It was even depressing even though he did so badly in the debate, I was depressed because I said, “It’s such a depressing thing he said.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-waterford-township-michigan-october-30","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Waterford Township, Michigan October 30","16:37"

It’s always the last question you know the guy, “Yes, I’m guilty. I’m guilty.” And then they end the show or they go to a commercial.

I said that refugees are coming in and they’ll promise him more than they give our citizens. They said, “We’re going to give you healthcare. We’re going to give you a free education. And every refugee that comes in will get a free Rolls Royce.” And CNN went crazy. They said, “President Trump lied. They’re not getting a Rolls Royce.” It’s true. They took it very seriously. You can’t be sarcastic. You can’t have a little bit of fun. Because if you do, you look very bad. No, they said, “It’s not true about the Rolls Royce.” But at 800,000 a pop, I would say probably not.

Under the Biden lockdown, countless Americans will die from suicide, drug overdose, deferred medical care. So many things happen, abuse. I mean, what’s happening? There will be no school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgivings, no Christmas, no 4th of July. There’ll be no nothing. There’ll be no future. Other than that, it’s quite a good plan, I think. Biden doesn’t have a clue. Look, the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself.

"President Donald Trump","Biden wants to keep everyone locked up, even young Americans who are at extremely low risk from the virus. He wants to steal the dreams and the futures of our youngest citizens. And when a child loses a year of his life because he’s locked in, and one thing we have found, telehealth has been great and a lot of the … But when you’re looking at a laptop, it’s not nearly as good as sitting in a classroom. That has been determined. It’s not good. It’s not the same. And we’re keeping these kids away from school and that’s something. I mean, it’s great in some instances and telehealth is one of them.

We tell our people, “Go out and vote.” We’re not big into the ballot world. We sort of don’t like it. Okay? Because too many tricks get played like they find Trump ballots in a wastepaper basket, they find them in dumpsters, they found some in the river. Lovely. Look, all those ballots. Oh, they happen to be Trump ballots. Now they’re finding them all over the place. 500 incorrect applications get sent to Virginia. The beauty was they sent many ballots to a certain state. They were only defective in one way. They didn’t have the name Trump on it. In other words, if you wanted to vote for Trump, what do you do? I guess you’re supposed to write it out? Then they’ll say, “You can’t do that.” No, it’s a crooked deal. It’s a crooked deal. It’s a very sad thing.

I could just see the governor of Nevada. I’m sure he never did this but, “Get me some ballots. We’re losing, here.” Because they don’t want to have any signature verification in Nevada. The governor, he was a political guy. He ran the political club. So he’s a beauty. So they don’t want to have any verification of a signature.

They kept saying, “Germany, Germany, Germany.” First of all, they have different ways of counting. In Germany, if you have a bad heart and you’re ready to die, or if you have cancer and you’re going to be dying soon and you catch COVID, that happens, we mark it down to COVID. Our doctors get more money if somebody dies from COVID. You know that, right? I mean, our doctors, they’re very smart people. So what they do is they say, “I’m sorry, but everybody dies of COVID.” But in Germany and other places, if you have a heart attack or if you have cancer, you’re terminally ill, you catch COVID, they say you died of cancer.

But don’t take my word for it because we have a video and I wanted to show you a little video, we only do this to people we really like because this thing cost a lot of money.
