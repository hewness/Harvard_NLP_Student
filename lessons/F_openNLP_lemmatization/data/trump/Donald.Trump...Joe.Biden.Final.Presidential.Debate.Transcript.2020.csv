"Kristen Welker","Good evening, everyone. Good evening. Thank you so much for being here. It is such an honor for me to moderate this debate tonight, the final debate. I want to welcome the first family and the first lady. We’re so glad and thankful that you are feeling better. I want to welcome the Biden family, Dr. Jill Biden. Thank you all for being here tonight. We are so excited. We’re looking forward to a really robust discussion. And the only thing I would reiterate are the CPD guidelines that when the candidates are talking, please hold any applause or any other reactions. Except of course, when they walk out, make sure you cheer and loud and applause so that everyone can hear you. Thank you for having me. This is really the honor of a lifetime. I am going to sit down and just get organized and get settled and the show will start very soon. Thank you for being here. (silence). Good evening from Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee. I’m Kristen Welker of NBC News. And I welcome you to the final 2020 presidential debate between President Donald J. Trump and former vice president Joe Biden. Tonight’s debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. It is conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the Commission’s health security advisor. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, boos, or other interruptions, except right now, as we welcome to the stage, former vice president Joe Biden and President Donald J. Trump.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","00:18"

"Kristen Welker","And I do want to say a very good evening to both of you. This debate will cover six major topics. At the beginning of each section, each candidate will have two minutes, uninterrupted, to answer my first question. The Debate Commission will then turn on their microphone only when it is their turn to answer. And the Commission will turn it off exactly when the two minutes have expired. After that, both microphones will remain on. But on behalf of the voters, I’m going to ask you to please speak one at a time.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","07:58"
"Kristen Welker","The goal is for you to hear each other and for the American people to hear every word of what you both have to say. And so with that, if you’re ready, let’s start. And we will begin with the fight against the coronavirus. President Trump, the first question is for you. The country is heading into a dangerous new phase. More than 40,000 Americans are in the hospital tonight with COVID, including record numbers here in Tennessee. And since the two of you last shared a stage, 16,000 Americans have died from COVID. So please be specific. How would you lead the country during this next stage of the coronavirus crisis? Two minutes, uninterrupted.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","08:27"

"Donald Trump","So as you know, 2.2 million people modeled out, were expected to die. We closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from China. It’s a worldwide pandemic. It’s all over the world. You see the spikes in Europe and many other places right now. If you notice, the mortality rate is down 85%. The excess mortality rate is way down and much lower than almost any other country. And we’re fighting it and we’re fighting it hard. There is a spike. There was a spike in Florida and it’s now gone.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","09:04"
"Donald Trump","There was a very big spike in Texas. It’s now gone. There was a very big spike in Arizona. It’s now gone. And there was some spikes and surges and other places, they will soon be gone. We have a vaccine that’s coming. It’s ready. It’s going to be announced within weeks. And it’s going to be delivered. We have Operation Warp Speed, which is the military is going to distribute the vaccine.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","09:41"
"Donald Trump","I can tell you from personal experience, I was in the hospital. I had it and I got better. And I will tell you that I had something that they gave me, a therapeutic, I guess they would call it. Some people could say it was a cure, but I was in for a short period of time. And I got better very fast or I wouldn’t be here tonight. And now they say I’m immune. Whether it’s four months or a lifetime, nobody’s been able to say that, but I’m immune. More and more people are getting better. We have a problem that’s a worldwide problem. This is a worldwide problem, but I’ve been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we’ve been able to do. If you take a look at what we’ve done in terms of goggles and masks and gowns and everything else, and in particular ventilators we’re now making ventilators all over the world, thousands and thousands a month distributing them all over the world. It will go away. And as I say, we’re rounding the turn. We’re rounding the corner. It’s going away.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","10:04"
"Kristen Welker","Okay. Former Vice President Biden to you. How would you lead the country out of this crisis? You have two minutes uninterrupted.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","11:06"
"Joe Biden","220,000 Americans dead. You hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this. Anyone who is responsible for not taking control. In fact, not saying I take no responsibility initially. Anyone is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as president of the United States of America. We’re in a situation where there are a thousand deaths a day now. A thousand deaths a day. And there are over 70,000 new cases per day. Compared to what’s going on in Europe as the New England Medical Journal said, they’re starting from a very low rate. We’re starting from a very high rate.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","11:13"
"Joe Biden","The expectation is we’ll have another 200,000 Americans dead between now and the end of the year. If we just wore these masks, the president’s own advisors have told him, we can save a 100,000 lives. And we’re in a circumstance where the president thus far and still has no plan, no comprehensive plan.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","11:56"
"Joe Biden","What I would do is make sure we have everyone encouraged to wear a mask all the time. I would make sure we move into the direction of rapid testing, investing in rapid testing. I would make sure that we set up national standards as to how to open up schools and open up businesses so they can be safe and give them the wherewithal, the financial resources to be able to do that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","12:19"
"Joe Biden","We’re in a situation now where the New England Medical Journal, one of the serious, most serious journals in the whole world said for the first time ever that the way this president has responded to this crisis has been absolutely tragic. And so folks, I will take care of this. I will end this. I will make sure we have a plan.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","12:41"
"Kristen Welker","President Trump, I’d like to follow up with you and your comments. You talked about taking a therapeutic, I assume you’re referencing Regeneron. You also said a vaccine will be coming within weeks. Is that a guarantee?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","13:01"
"Donald Trump","No, it’s not a guarantee, but it will be by the end of the year. But I think it has a good chance. There are two companies, I think within a matter of weeks and it will be distributed very quickly.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","13:13"
"Kristen Welker","Can you tell us which companies?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","13:22"
"Donald Trump","Johnson & Johnson is doing very well. Moderna is doing very well. Pfizer is doing very well and we have numerous others. Then we also have others that we’re working on very closely with other countries, in particular Europe.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","13:23"
"Kristen Welker","Let me follow up with you and because this is new information. You have set a vaccine is coming soon within weeks now. Your own officials say, “It could take well into 2021 at the earliest for enough Americans to get vaccinated.” And even then they say, “The country will be wearing masks and distancing into 2022.” Is your timeline realistic?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","13:35"
"Donald Trump","No, I think my timeline is going to be more accurate. I don’t know that they’re counting on the military the way I do, but we have our generals lined up, one in particular that’s the head of logistics and this is a very easy distribution for him. He’s ready to go. As soon as we have the vaccine and we expect to have a 100 million vials. As soon as we have the vaccine, he’s ready to go.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","13:53"
"Kristen Welker","Vice President Biden, your reaction. And just 40% of Americans say they would definitely agree to take a coronavirus vaccine if it was approved by the government. What steps would you take to give Americans confidence in a vaccine if it were approved?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","14:13"
"Joe Biden","Make sure it’s totally transparent. Have the scientists of the world see it, know it, look at it, go through all the processes. And by the way, this is the same fellow who told you, “This is going to end by Easter” last time. This is the same fellow who told you that, “Don’t worry, we’re going to end this by the summer.” We’re about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter and he has no clear plan. And there’s no prospect that there’s going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the American people before the middle of next year.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","14:26"

"Donald Trump","I don’t think we’re going to have a dark winter at all. We’re opening up our country. We’ve learned and studied and understand the disease, which we didn’t at the beginning. When I closed and banned China from coming in heavily infected and then ultimately Europe, but China was in January. Months later, he was saying I was xenophobic. I did it too soon. Now he’s saying, “Oh, I should have moved quicker,” but he didn’t move quicker. He was months behind me, many months behind me.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","14:56"
"Donald Trump","And frankly, he ran the H1N1 swine flu and it was a total disaster. Far less lethal, but it was a total disaster. Had that had this kind of numbers, 700,000 people would be dead right now, but it was a far less lethal disease. Look, his own person who ran that for him, who, as you know, was his chief of staff said, “It was catastrophic. It was horrible. We didn’t know what we were doing.” Now he comes up and he tells us how to do this.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","15:24"
"Donald Trump","Also, everything that he said about the way every single move that he said we should make, that’s what we’ve done. We’ve done all of it. But he was way behind us.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","16:01"

"Joe Biden","My response is he is xenophobic, but not because he shutdown access from China. And he did it late after 40 countries had already done that. In addition to that, what he did, he made sure that we had 44 people that were in there in China trying to get the Wuhan to determine what exactly the source was. What did the president say in January? He said, ” No.” He said, “He’s being transparent. The president of China is being transparent. We owe him a debt of gratitude. We have to thank him.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","16:12"
"Joe Biden","And then what happened was we started talking about using the Defense Act to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people. And again, I go back to this. He had nothing, he did virtually nothing. And then he gets out of the hospital and he talks about, “Oh, don’t worry. It’s all going to be over soon.” Come on. There’s not another serious scientist in the world who thinks it’s going to be over soon.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","16:38"

"Donald Trump","I didn’t say over soon. I say we’re learning to live with it. We have no choice. We can’t lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does. He has the ability to lock himself up. I don’t know. He’s obviously made a lot of money someplace, but he has this thing about living in a basement. People can’t do that. By the way I as the president couldn’t do that. I’d love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the White House and go away for a year and a half until it disappears. I can’t do that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","17:04"
"Donald Trump","And Kirsten, every meeting I had, every meeting I had and I’d meet a lot of families, including gold star families and military families. Every meeting I had and I had to meet them, I had to. It would be horrible to have canceled everything. I said, “This is dangerous and you catch it.” And I caught it. I learned a lot. I learned a lot. Great doctors, great hospitals. And now I recovered. 99.9 of young people recover. 99% of people recover. We have to recover-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","17:31"

"Joe Biden","Number one, he says that we’re learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it. You folks home will have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning. That man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch, there out of habit, where their wife or husband was, is gone. Learning to live with it. Come on. We’re dying with it, because he’s never said. See, you said, “It’s dangerous.” When’s the last time? Is it really dangerous still? Are we dangerous. You tell the people it’s dangerous now. What should they do about the danger?

"Donald Trump","Excuse me. I take full responsibility. It’s not my fault that it came here. It’s China’s fault. And you know what? It’s not Joe’s fault that it came here either. It’s China’s fault. They kept it from going into the rest of China for the most part, but they didn’t keep it from coming out to the world, including Europe and ourselves.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","18:58"

"Joe Biden","The fact is that when we knew it was coming, when it hit, what happened? What did the President say? He said, “Don’t worry. It’s going to go away. It’ll be gone by Easter. Don’t worry. Warm weather. Don’t worry. Maybe inject bleach.” He said he was kidding when he said that, but a lot of people thought it was serious. A whole range of things the President has said, even today, he thinks we are in control.

"Donald Trump","Look, perhaps just to finish this, I was kidding on that, but just to finish this, when I closed he said I shouldn’t have closed. And that went on for months. Nancy Pelosi said the same thing. She was dancing on the streets in Chinatown, in San Francisco. But when I closed, he said, “This is a terrible thing, you xenophobic.” I think he called me racist even, because I was closing it to China. Now he says I should have closed it earlier.

"Kristen Welker","Okay. Let’s talk about your different strategies toward dealing with this. Mr. Vice President you suggested you would support new shutdowns if scientists recommended it. What do you say to Americans who are fearful that the cost of shutdowns, the impact on the economy, the higher rates of hunger, depression, domestic, and substance abuse outweighs the risk of exposure to the virus?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","20:33"
"Joe Biden","What I would say is, I’m going to shut down the virus, not the country. It’s his ineptitude that caused the country to have to shut down in large part, why businesses have gone under, why schools are closed, why so many people have lost their living, and why they’re concerned. Those other concerns are real. That’s why he should have been, instead of in a sand trap at his golf course, he should have been negotiating with Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the Democrats and Republicans about what to do about the acts they were passing for billions of dollars to make sure people had the capacity.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","20:54"

"Joe Biden","Oh, well, no. I’m not shutting down today, but there are … Look, you need standards. The standard is, if you have a reproduction rate in a community that’s above a certain level, everybody says, “Slow up. More social distancing. Do not open bars and do not open gymnasiums. Do not open until you get this under control, under more control.” But when you do open, give the people the capacity to be able to open and have the capacity to do it safely. For example, schools. Schools, they need a lot of money to be open. They need to deal with ventilation systems. They need to deal with smaller classes, more teachers, more pods, and he’s refused to support that money, or at least up to now.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","21:25"

"Donald Trump","Thank you, and I appreciate that. Look, all he does is talk about shut downs. But forget about him. His Democrat Governors, Cuomo in New York, you look at what’s going on in California, you look at Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Democrats, Democrats all, they’re shut down so tight and they’re dying. They’re dying. And he supports all these people. All he talks about is shut downs. No, we’re not going to shut down. And we have to open our schools. And it’s like, as an example, I have a young son, he also tested positive. By the time I spoke to the doctor the second time, he was fine. It just went away.

But just yesterday, Boston became the latest city to move its public school system entirely online after a coronavirus spike. What is your message to parents who worry that sending their children to school will endanger not only their kids but also their teachers and family?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","22:47"
"Donald Trump","I want to open the schools. The transmittal rate to the teachers is very small. But I want to open the schools. We have to open our country. We’re not going to have a country. You can’t do this. We can’t keep this country closed. This is a massive country with a massive economy. People are losing their jobs. They’re committing suicide.

"Joe Biden","Simply not true. We ought to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. We ought to be able to safely open, but they need resources to open? You need to be able to, for example, if you’re going to open a business, have social distancing within the business. You need to have, if you have a restaurant, you need to have plexiglass dividers so people cannot infect one another. You need to be in a position where you can take testing rapidly and know whether the person is in fact infected. You need to be able to trace. You need to be able to provide all the resources that are needed to do this. And that is not inconsistent with saying that we’re going to make sure that we’re going to open safely. And by the way, all you teachers out there, not that many of you are going to die, so don’t worry about it. So don’t worry about it.

And when you talk about plexiglass, these are restaurants that had dying. These are businesses with no money. Putting up plexiglass is unbelievably expensive, and it’s not the answer. I mean, you’re going to sit there in a cubicle wrapped around with plastic. These are businesses that are dying, Joe. You can’t do that to people. You just can’t.

And I don’t look at this in terms of the way he does, blue states and red states. They’re all the United States. And look at the states that are having such a spike in the coronavirus. They’re the red states, they’re the states in the Midwest, they’re the states in the upper Midwest. That’s where the spike is occurring significantly. But they’re all Americans. They’re all Americans. And what we have to do is say, wear these masks, number one. Make sure we get the help that the businesses need. That money’s already been passed to do that.

He said, “This is not going to be a problem. We are not going to have a problem at all.” When Joe says that I said, Anthony Fauci said, and others, and many others. And I’m not knocking him, nobody knew. Look, nobody knew what this thing was. Nobody knew where it was coming from, what it was. We’ve learned a lot. But Anthony said “Don’t wear masks,” now he wants to wear masks. Anthony also said, if you look back, exact words, here’s his exact words. “This is no problem.

"Joe Biden","My response is that think about what the President knew in January and didn’t tell the American people. He was told this was a serious virus that spread in the air, and it was much worse, much worse, than the flu. He went on record and said to one of your colleagues, recorded, that in fact he knew how dangerous it was but he didn’t want to tell us. He didn’t want to tell us because he didn’t want us to panic. He didn’t want us… Americans don’t panic. He panicked. But guess what, in the meantime, we find out in the New York Times the other day, that in fact his folks went to Wall Street and said, “This is a really dangerous thing.” And a memo out of that meeting — not from his administration, but from some of the brokers — said, “Sell short, because we’ve got to get moving. It’s a dangerous problem.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","27:48"

And it’s been overwhelmingly clear this election — I won’t even get into the last one — this election, that Russia has been involved, China’s been involved to some degree, and now we learn that Iran is involved.

And Joe, you were vice-president when some of this was happening, and it should have never happened. And I think you owe an explanation to the American people. Why is it, somebody just had a news conference a little while ago who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family, but what he said was damning.

"Kristen Welker","All right, gentlemen. Let me just ask some questions about all of this broadly.

"Joe Biden","Nothing was unethical. Here’s what the deal. With regard to Ukraine. We had this whole question about whether or not, because he was on the board, I later learned of Burisma, a company that somehow, I had done something wrong, yet every single solitary person, when he was going through his impeachment, testifying under oath, who work for him, said I did my job impeccably. I carried out U.S. policy, not one single solitary thing was out of line, not a single thing, number one.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","06:24"
"Joe Biden","Number two, the guy who got in trouble in Ukraine was this guy trying to bribe the Ukrainian government to say something negative about me, which they would not do and did not do because it never ever, ever happened.

And then I decided, because I was going to do… I was thinking about doing a deal in China, like millions of other people, I was thinking about it and I decided I’m not going to do it, didn’t like it, I decided not to do it, had an account open and I closed it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","08:19"

We just flew B-52, B-1 bombers through it. We’re not going to pay attention. They have to play by the rules. And what’s he do?

"Donald Trump","So when I met with Barack Obama, we sat in the White House, right at the beginning, had a great conversation. Was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour. He said, “The biggest problem we have is North Korea.” He indicated we will be in a war with North Korea. Guess what? It would be a nuclear war. And he does have plenty of nuclear capability. In the meantime, I have a very good relationship with him. Different kind of a guy, but he probably thinks the same thing about me. We have a different kind of a relationship. We have a very good relationship and there’s no war. And about two months ago, he broke into a certain area. They said, “Oh, there’s going to be trouble.” I said, “No, they’re not, because he’s not going to do that.” And I was right. Look, instead of being in a war where millions of people, Seoul is 25 miles away, millions and millions, 32 million people. Millions of people would be dead right now.

"Joe Biden","Because I’d make it clear, which we were making clear to China, they had to be part of the deal, because I made it clear as a spokesperson for the illustration when I went to China that I said, “Why are you moving your missile defense up so close? Why are you moving more forces here? Why are you continue to do military maneuvers with South Korea?” I said, “Because North Korea is a problem, and we’re going to continue to do it so we can control them. We’re going to make sure we can control them and make sure they can not hurt us. And so if you want to do something about it, step up and help. If not, it’s going to continue.” What has he done? He’s legitimized North Korea. He’s talked about his good buddy, who’s a thug, a thug. And he talks about how we’re better off. And they have much more capable missiles, able to reach us territory much more easily than they ever did before.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","14:42"

"Kristen Welker","Okay, let’s move on to American families and the economy. One of the issues that’s most important to them is healthcare, as you both know. Today, there was a key vote on a new Supreme Court Justice, Amy Coney Barrett, and healthcare is at the center of her confirmation fight. Over 20 million Americans get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. It’s headed to the Supreme Court and your administration, Mr. President, is advocating for the court to overturn it. If the Supreme Court does overturn that law, there’s 20 million Americans could lose their health insurance almost overnight. So what would you do if those people have their health insurance taken away? You have two minutes uninterrupted.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","17:03"
"Donald Trump","First of all, I’ve already done something that nobody thought was possible. Through the legislature, I terminated the individual mandate. That is the worst part of Obamacare, as we call it. The individual mandate where you have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance, I terminated. It’s gone. Now, it’s in court, because Obamacare is no good. But then I made a decision, run it as well as you can, to my people, great people, run it as well as you can. I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy. They ran it. Premiums are down. Everything’s down. Here’s the problem. No matter how well you run it, it’s no good. What we’d like to do is terminate it. We have the individual mandate done. I don’t know that it’s going to work. If we don’t win, we will have to run it and we’ll have Obamacare, but it’ll be better run. But it no longer is Obamacare, because without the individual mandate, it’s much different.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","17:40"
"Donald Trump","Pre-existing conditions will always stay. What I would like to do is a much better healthcare, much better. We’ll always protect people with pre-existing. So I’d like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new, beautiful healthcare. The Democrats will do it, because there’ll be tremendous pressure on them. And we might even have the House by that time. And I think we’re going to win the House. You’ll see, but I think we’re going to win the House. But come up with a better healthcare, always protecting people with pre-existing conditions. And one thing very important, we have 180 million people out there that have great private healthcare. Far more than we’re talking about with Obamacare. Joe Biden is going to terminate all of those policies. These are people that love their healthcare. People that have been successful, middle-income people, been successful. They have 180 million plans, 180 million people, families. Under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine, he won’t even have a choice, they want to terminate 180 million plans. We have done an incredible job at healthcare, and we’re going to do even better. Just you watch.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","18:36"
"Kristen Welker","Okay. Vice President Biden, yes, this is for you. Your healthcare plan calls for building on Obamacare. So my question is, what is your plan if the law is ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court? You have two minutes uninterrupted.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","19:43"
"Joe Biden","What I’m going to do is pass Obamacare with a public option, and become Bidencare. The public option is an option that says that if you in fact do not have the wherewithal, if you qualify for Medicaid and you do not have the wherewithal in your state to get Medicaid, you automatically are enrolled, providing competition for insurance companies. That’s what’s going to happen. Secondly, we’re going to make sure we reduce the premiums and reduce drug prices by making sure that there’s competition, that doesn’t exist now, by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the insurance companies. Thirdly, the idea that I want to eliminate private insurance, the reason why I had such a fight with 20 candidates for the nomination was I support private insurance. That’s why. Not one single person with private insurance would lose their insurance under my plan, nor did they under Obamacare. They did not lose their insurance unless they chose they wanted to go to something else.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","19:56"
"Joe Biden","Lastly, we’re going to make sure we’re in a situation that we actually protect pre-existing. There’s no way he can protect pre-existing conditions. None, zero. You can’t do it in the ether. He’s been talking about this for a long time. He’s never come up with a plan. I guess we’re going to get the pre-existing condition plan the same time we got the infrastructure plan that we waited for since ’17, ’18, ’19, and 20. I still have a few more minutes. I know you’re getting anxious. The fact is that he’s already cost the American people, because of his terrible handling of the COVID virus and economic spillover. 10 million people have lost their private insurance, and he wants to take away 22 million more people who have it under Obamacare and over 110 million people with pre-existing conditions. And all the people from COVID are going to have pre-existing conditions, what are they going to do?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","20:59"

"Joe Biden","I say it’s ridiculous. It’s like saying that the fact that there’s a public option that people can choose, that makes it a socialist plan. Look, the difference between the president and I… I think healthcare is not a privilege, it’s a right. Everyone should have the right to have affordable healthcare, and I am very proud of my plan. It’s gotten endorsed by all the major labor unions, as well as a whole range of other people who, in fact, are concerned in the medical field. This is something that’s going to save people’s lives. And this is going to give some people an opportunity to have healthcare for their children. How many of you at home are worried and rolling around in bed tonight, wondering what in God’s name you’re going to do if you get sick, because you’ve lost your health insurance and your company’s gone under? We have to provide health insurance for people at an affordable rate, and that’s what I do.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","22:09"

You’re going to have socialized medicine, just like you want it with fracking. “We’re not going to have fracking. We’re going to stop fracking. We’re going to stop fracking.” Then he goes to Pennsylvania after he gets a nomination, where he got very lucky to get it.

And then they have to fire firefighters, teachers, first responders, law enforcement officers, so they could keep their cities and counties running. He will not support that. They have not done a thing for them. And Mitch McConnell said, “Let them go bankrupt. Let them go bankrupt.” Come on.

"Donald Trump","The bill that was passed in the House was a bailout of badly run, high crime, Democrat, all run by Democrat cities and states. It was a way of getting a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars, to these guys. It was also a way of getting a lot of money from our people’s pockets to people that come into our country illegally. We were going to take care of everything for them. And I’d love to do that. I’d love to help them. But what that does, everybody all over the world will start pouring into our country. We can’t do it. This was a way of taking care of them. This was a way of spending on things that had nothing to do with COVID, as per your question. But it was really a big bailout for badly run Democrat cities and states.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","28:56"

I never had to tell my daughter if she’s pulled over, make sure she puts… For a traffic stop. “Put both hands on top of the wheel and don’t reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you.” But a Black parent, no matter how wealthy or how poor they are, has to teach their child, “When you’re walking down the street, don’t have a hoodie on when you go across the street.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","39:14"

We have to provide for economic opportunity, better education, better healthcare, better access to schooling, better access to opportunity to borrow money to start businesses, all the things we can do.

And if you look, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln, possible exception, but the exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has done what I’ve done. Criminal justice reform, Obama and Joe didn’t do it. I don’t even think they tried because they had no chance at doing it. They might’ve wanted to do it. But if you had to see the arms I had to twist to get that done, it was not a pretty picture. And everybody knows it, including some very liberal people that cried in my office. They cried in the Oval Office.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","01:15"

He came in with this incredible idea for Opportunity Zones. It’s one of the most successful programs. People don’t talk about it. Tremendous investment is being made, biggest beneficiary, the black and Hispanic communities. And then Historically Black Colleges and Universities, after three years of coming to the office, I love some of those guys, they were great. They came into the office and I said, “What are you doing?” After three years, I said, “Why do you keep coming back?” Because we have no funding.” I said, “You don’t have to come back every year.” “We have to come back.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","02:15"

"Joe Biden","My response to that is I never ever said what he accused me of saying. The fact of the matter is in 2000 though, after the crime bill had been in the law for awhile, this is a guy who said, “The problem with the crime bill, there’s not enough people in jail. There’s not enough people in jail.” And go on my website, get the quote, the date when he said it, “not enough people.” He talked about marauding gangs, young gangs, and the people who are going to maraud our cities. This is a guy who in the Central Park Five, five innocent black kids, he continued to push for making sure that they got the death penalty. None of them were guilty of the crimes they were suggested. Look and granted, he did in fact, let 20 people … he commuted 20 people’s sentences.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","03:23"
"Joe Biden","We commuted over 1,000 people’s sentences, over 1,000. The very law he’s talking about is a law that in fact, initiated by Barack Obama. And secondly, we’re in a situation here where the federal prison system was reduced by 38,000 people under our administration. And one of those things we should be doing, there should be no, no minimum mandatories in the law. That’s why I’m offering $20 billion to states to change their state laws to eliminate minimum mandatories and set up drug courts. No one should be going to jail because they have a drug problem. They should be going to rehabilitation, not to jail. We should fundamentally change the system and that’s what I’m going to do.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","04:12"

I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies because of the Paris Accord, it was so unfair. China doesn’t kick in until 2030, Russia goes back to a low standard, and we kicked in right away, it would have been… It would have destroyed our businesses. So, you ready?

And we’re told by all the leading scientists in the world we don’t have much time, we’re going to pass the point of no return within the next 8 to 10 years. Four more years of this man eliminating all the regulations that were put in by us to clean up the climate, to clean up… To limit the emissions, will put us in a position where we’re going to be in real trouble. Here’s where we have a great opportunity.

In the meantime, China is doing that.

That’s what’s happening and what right now, by the way, Wall Street firms indicated that my plan, my plan will in fact, create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more than his.

"Kristen Welker","All right. This is about leadership, gentlemen. And this first question does go to you, President Trump. Imagine this is your inauguration day. What will you say in your address, to Americans who did not vote for you? You’ll each have one minute, starting with you, Mr. Trump.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","24:30"
"Donald Trump","We have to make our country totally successful, as it was prior to the plague coming in from China. Now we’re rebuilding it and we’re doing record numbers, 11.4 million jobs in a short period of time, et cetera. But, I will tell you, go back.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","24:47"
"Donald Trump","Before the plague came in, just before, I was getting calls from people that were not normally people that would call me. They wanted to get together. We had the best Black unemployment numbers in the history of our country. Hispanic, women, Asian, people with diplomas, with no diplomas, MIT graduates; number one in the class, everybody had the best numbers. And you know what? The other side wanted to get together. They wanted to unify.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","25:01"
"Donald Trump","Success is going to bring us together. We are on the road to success. But I’m cutting taxes, and he wants to raise everybody’s taxes and he wants to put new regulations on everything. He will kill it. If he gets in, you will have a Depression, the likes of which you’ve never seen. Your 401(k)s will go to hell, and it’ll be a very, very sad day for this country.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","25:28"

"Joe Biden","I will say, I’m an American President. I represent all of you, whether you voted for me or against me, and I’m going to make sure that you’re represented. I’m going to give you hope. We’re going to move; we’re going to choose science over fiction. We’re going to choose hope over fear. We’re going to choose to move forward because we have enormous opportunities, enormous opportunities to make things better.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","25:57"
"Joe Biden","We can grow this economy, we can deal with the systemic racism. At the same time, we can make sure that our economy is being run and moved and motivated by clean energy, creating millions of new jobs. That’s the fact, that’s what we’re going to do. And I’m going to say, as I said at the beginning, what is on the ballot here is the character of this country. Decency, honor, respect. Treating people with dignity, making sure that everyone has an even chance. And I’m going to make sure you get that. You haven’t been getting it the last four years.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Joe Biden Final Presidential Debate Transcript 2020","26:19"
