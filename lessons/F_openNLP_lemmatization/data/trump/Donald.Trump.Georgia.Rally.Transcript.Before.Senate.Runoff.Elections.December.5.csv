"Melania Trump","It is wonderful to be here with you tonight. Thank you for coming out and supporting us. President Trump continues to fight for you every single day. Do not let your voices be silenced. We must keep our seats in the Senate. It is more important than ever that your exercise your rights as an American citizen and vote. Under my husband’s leadership, our borders are safer global, terrorists have been destroyed, and historic peace deals in the Middle East have been made. Our nation is respected again and our allies are now doing their fair share globally. President Trump has brought jobs back to the American people. And opportunities for women have expanded in our workforce. Our economy has soared and unemployment has shrunk. When a global pandemic hit the United States last January, my husband put the American peoples first. And now under this administration and because of our amazing medical capabilities and resources, we are closer than ever to vaccinate that will save millions of lives. Let your voices be heard, Georgia.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","02:55"

"Donald Trump","Well, thank you very much. Thank you. No, we won a lot of places. We won Florida. We won Ohio. Big, big. We won them big. Remember we were going to lose Florida they said. We were five down in Florida. We won by a lot. We were way down in Ohio and we won by a lot. I think they say that if you win Florida and if you win Ohio in history, you’ve never lost an election. This has got to be a first time. But the truth is they were right, we’ve never lost that election. We’re winning this election. And I will say, we’re fighting very hard for this state. When you look at all of the corruption and all of the problems having to do with this election, all I can do is campaign and then I wait for the numbers. But when the numbers come out of ceilings and come out of leather bags, you start to say, “What’s going on?” But I want to just tell you that I love this state. I love the people in this state and I’m thrilled to be back in magnificent Georgia with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","06:24"
"Donald Trump","Let me begin by wishing you all a very Merry Christmas. Remember the word. Remember. We started five years ago, and I said you’re going to be saying Christmas again. And we say it proudly again, although there’ll be trying to take that word again out of the vocabulary. We’re not going to let them do that. I also want to express our profound condolences to the family of Harrison Deal, a young and brilliant campaign staffer for Senator Loeffler, who tragically died in a terrible car accident yesterday. You know about it. He was an incredible magnificent young man. And I just want to say our prayers are with his friends and loved ones and we will keep his memory in our hearts. And he’s looking down right now and he’s very proud of Kelly and David. He’s very proud of all of us. So I just want to express my best wishes to the family and everybody. Thank you. Thank you, Kelly. And let me also express our warmest best wishes and love to all of those people and families suffering from the COVID pandemic. Vaccines are on their way at a level that nobody ever thought possible. It would have taken another administration five years. It took us seven months and they’re starting next week and we’re going to start vaccinating. And a lot of people already are vaccinated. It’s called you have … You caught it and you’re immune. I hope it’s true. They say that before I had it, they said if you catch it, you’re immune for life. Once I got it, they said, if you catch it, you’re immune for four months. Right.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","07:33"
"Donald Trump","But they’re on their way, the vaccines and they’re great vaccines and safe, and brilliant actually to think of it, what we’ve done in such a short period of time. Nobody thought. They call it, even some of the enemies call it a medical miracle what we’ve done. And we also have great therapeutics and they’re already here and I can testify to that fact. I’ll tell you what, some incredible work has been done over the last seven months. And we should always get credit for that. Don’t let anyone ever take it away from us.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","09:13"
"Donald Trump","We’re gathered here tonight to ensure … A very important word, ensure because these are two great, great people that I know so well and respected by everybody in Washington and beyond, that David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler win the most important congressional runoff, probably in American history. I really believe that. I think it’s in American … There’s never been a time like this, where you have two at one time, at least you have two beauties. And you know what, you also have two beauties running against them, but beauty in a different way, there are two beauties.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","09:45"
"Donald Trump","But there’s never been a case where a state has had this prominence on Senate races because they’re never together. And this is something that’s very important and you have to get out and you have to vote. You have to make sure you have every vote counted. Every one has to count. You got to make sure they don’t throw away any ballots. You got to make sure that when they collect the ballots and they start bragging about how many ballots they already have, you got to make sure your secretary of state knows what the hell he’s doing. And you got to make sure your governor gets a lot tougher than he’s been. He’s got to get a lot tougher. Because at stake in this election is control of the US Senate and that really means control of this country. The voters of Georgia will determine which party runs every committee, writes every piece of legislation, controls every single taxpayer dollar.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","10:21"
"Donald Trump","Very simply, you will decide whether your children will grow up in a socialist country or whether they will grow up in a free country. And I will tell you this, socialist is just the beginning for these people. These people want to go further than socialism. They want to go into a communistic form of government. I have no doubt about it. Somehow that doesn’t suit Georgia too well. That doesn’t work too well I think, Kelly, in Georgia, does it?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","11:18"
"Donald Trump","David and Kelly are running against radical Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. Ossoff and Warnock are the two most extreme, far-left liberal Senate candidates in the history of our country, and you got them both at one time. How did that happen? I think you both got lucky, but we’ll see, right? We’ll see. You must go vote and vote early starting December 14th. You have to do it. They cheated and they rigged our presidential election, but we will still win it. We will still win it. We’ll still win it. And they’re going to try and rig this election too.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","11:49"

"Donald Trump","No, we continue to fight. We’ve had some great moments. We just need somebody with courage to do what they have to do because everyone knows it’s wrong. We need somebody with courage, somebody that makes decisions, then we’ll be going up to the Supreme Court very shortly. And we really, if we have-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","12:54"

"Donald Trump","If we have courage and wisdom, I think, you know what the answer’s going to be because you can’t let people get away with what they got away with. Think of it, with over 74 million votes, over, think of that, more than … I got more votes than any sitting president in history. 11 million more votes than we got in 2016. And we thought that if we could get 68 million, 67 million that would be the end. All of our great, brilliant geniuses said you’d win if you get 67 or 68. It’s over. We got 74 million-plus and they’re trying to convince us that we lost. We didn’t lose. They found a lot of ballots to be nice about it. And they got rid of some too. The 74, let me tell you, the 74 could have been even higher.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","13:17"
"Donald Trump","As the great pollster, John McLaughlin, who was really a great pollster, one of the most highly respected, he said, “There’s no way this could have happened other than the obvious cheating or a rigged election. There’s no way it could have happened.” It’s interesting, I wrote this out and I had just a few of the facts, which I think … Because I want to get onto the presidentials. I want to stay on presidential, but I got to get to these two because they’re incredible. But listen to this. These are the facts. And each fact is irrefutable and it means win. President Trump received, done by one of the most brilliant political people, President Trump received more votes than any previous incumbent president in history. And we lost. And we lost. So, we received more votes than anybody in history, any incumbent in history, and we lost, supposedly. We didn’t lose. You’re going to see that. No incumbent who received 75% of the total primary vote lost reelection in the history of our country. President Trump received 94, not 74. 94, which is one of the highest in history.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","14:10"
"Donald Trump","In fact, President Trump is the only one of five incumbents since 1912 to receive more than 90% of the primary vote. And again, anybody received over 75%, they won. We got 94%. President Trump set a record for the most primary votes ever received by an incumbent, ever. And nobody that’s received all of the primary votes, nobody’s received at a much lesser level than what we, they always won. But we didn’t according to what they say. It’s rigged. It’s a fixed deal. Nationally, initial numbers show that 26% of President Trump’s voting share came from nonwhite voters. The highest percentage for a GOP presidential candidate since 1960. That’s a long time ago. President Trump won … Think of this one. President Trump won 18 of 19 bellwether counties. You know what a bellwether county is, it’s a big deal. So I won 18 of 19, a record, never happened. That between 1980 and 2016 voted for the eventual president in every single election, and before that, it was almost every election. And we won a record 18 of 19. Never lost. Nobody’s ever lost with anything like that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","15:21"
"Donald Trump","Biden did not demonstrate coattails for the downballot races, had no coattails. I’m shocked to hear that. In fact, he got 80 million votes. But what he made a Thanksgiving day speech on the internet, they say he had less than a thousand people. How do you have 80 million votes and you have a thousand people? Now how do you have 80 million votes and you have less than a thousand people?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","16:48"
"Donald Trump","With Republicans maintaining control … So here’s what happened. So Biden didn’t demonstrate coattails downballot races, but with Republicans maintaining control, first time this has ever happened, control of the Senate, winning all 27 toss-up races in the House. Kevin McCarthy, great job. Mitch, great job. Winning all 27 toss-up races. And now, think of it. We didn’t lose a seat in the House. Think of this. The first time that anybody, I think in history, we didn’t lose one seat. Normally, you lose two, three, five, and you replay. We lost nobody sitting in Congress. I worked hard in the House, with Kevin McCarthy, not losing a single legislative chamber and making big gains at the state level and holding onto the Senate. I mean, look at what’s happened. We better hold onto the Senate, you two. And there’s never been numbers like that where a president even came close to losing, but they say we lost. The only way is they stuffed the ballot boxes.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","17:12"
"Donald Trump","President Trump won. President Trump won as we said both in Florida and then Ohio. And by the way, won by a lot. Remember the fake polls where they said he’s down by four in Florida, and I won by a lot. He’s down by two in Ohio, and we won. I think we got eight or nine or something, up. But nobody’s ever done that. Those two very powerful, big, important states. And the beauty is that we also won Georgia, and that was good. We won South Carolina and we won Iowa. Remember, we’re not going to win an Iowa they said. We’re not going to win. I think the farmers like Trump a lot, right? Well, we want an Iowa by a lot. We won in Iowa by close to record numbers. I think I have the record. And we won all over the place.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","18:14"
"Donald Trump","And many of these swing states, it’s a very interesting statistic. President Obama beat Biden all over the country, except in some of the swing states where Biden beat him badly. How does that work? And they say it’s statistically impossible. He beat crooked Hillary. Think of this. He beat crooked Hillary in the swing states, but she beat him everywhere else. Let me tell you, this election was rigged and we can’t let it happen to two of the greatest, most respected people in Washington. We can’t let it happen again. Can’t let it happen.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","19:06"

"Donald Trump","Your governor could stop it very easily if he knew what the hell he was doing. He could stop it very easily. Hundreds of thousands of illegal votes were cast in each state. Far from … I mean, if you look at this, hundreds of thousands more than we needed were cast in every state we’re talking about, not only here, but Michigan, Pennsylvania. How about Pennsylvania where they throw the poll Watchers out? They threw them out. They literally threw them out. And they did it here too, by the way. But we caught them cold and have numerous cases pending. And so far we haven’t been able to find the people with the courage to do the right thing. And that is true in Georgia, certainly. But we’re going to hit those people and they’re going to go down in history as great people. They’re going to go down because everyone knows what took place.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","19:58"
"Donald Trump","But we’re going to talk about the presidential election a little bit later because we have a big senatorial race going on in Georgia and we are watching Democrats very, very closely. And remember this, we had this massive race all over the country, so they could cheat in Georgia and people aren’t really watching it like they should. And again, all I can do is say I’m running, win, and then do a good job as president. That’s all. I don’t run the elections. I don’t run to see if people are walking in with suitcases and putting them under a table with a black robe around it. I don’t do that. That’s up to your government here. And for whatever reason, your secretary of state and your governor are afraid of Stacey Abrams. They’re afraid of her.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","20:47"
"Donald Trump","So we know the Democrats are planning to cheat and we can’t let them do it again. And we’re going to pull ours out one way or the other. But we have to be vigilant because I don’t want these two to work like that I … I thought we were going to easily win. And then maybe for the first time in a long time, I’d go take a nice little vacation for about two days and then we’d go back. And instead, I probably worked harder in the last three weeks than I’ve ever worked in my life doing this.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","21:37"

Where’s Burt Jones. Where’s Burt Jones? Burt. Burt, boy, you’re a young guy. I thought you were young, but not that young. Burt Jones, I want to thank you, Burt, for being here. You’re friendly with a man next to you, right? He’s a man of courage. Thank you very much, Burt. I appreciate everything you’re doing and so does this big crowd. And this is a big … This is a lot of people. Also, Brandon Beach, Senator Brandon Beach. Brandon, thank you for everything. We appreciate it. William Liggins. William. Where’s William?

"Donald Trump","And we said, have this brought back into your legislature, governor, have it brought back. Let these people make it. Keep it open, keep it transparent, and let us have a signature verification. What’s wrong with that? They keep counting the same votes. I said, “Don’t count votes, look at the signature. You’re going to find the signatures aren’t what they were two years ago, four years ago, six years ago.” But are two great Senate opponents, and these are the two people that fight and they’re going to fight like … I don’t know if you know this, but one of the people that you’re fighting, I went against him, Ossoff, four years ago. He was against a very fine woman, Karen, who was a great woman, and he was leading by quite a bit and we ended up beating him. He didn’t even live in the district. He was running for Congress. He didn’t even live in the district.

That’s Chuck Schumer. He made the statement. “We’re going to investigate him.” Oh, those investigations, we’ll go on and on. Well, they’ve been investigating me since the day we came down on the escalator, which what turned out to be our great First Lady, we came down to the escalator, right? Okay.

We own this farm.” Here’s exactly how they will change America forever.

It’s a big national security. So hopefully, Mitch and the senators will put it in. But it’s the one chance we have to bring big tech, who are vicious and violent and untruthful, to bring big tech … It’s the only thing they fear is that we’re going to end Section 230.

We would also like to save the names of the forts if you don’t mind everybody. They have the right. They put in the Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren clause, where they have the right to take all the names of our past warriors heroes in some cases, many cases, some turned out to be heroes in disguise, perhaps, but they want to take the names off and they have the right to desecrate, to take down, to destroy, to demolish places in our national parks that we don’t want demolished.

You won’t ever win another election as a Republic. They even want to take down the wall. The wall, I won on the wall too. We won on a lot of things. “Take down the wall,” I heard him say it the other day. “We will take down the wall.” We have the strongest border we’ve ever had now. We’re almost finished with the wall. Strongest border, right, Sonny? And we built it despite … It’s incredible, the effect it’s having. We built it despite, everybody said no chance.

"Donald Trump","Oppose me. And yesterday, I don’t know if you saw it, the court just ruled that the money I took was taken legally. So at least we have a legal wall. The appeals court. So we took it and we built the wall and we’ll be finished with it very soon, but it’s had a tremendous impact on illegal immigrants coming into the country. And by the way, we want people to come into our country, you see that by the vote I got, but we want people to come in legally and through merit. Through merit, where they can help us.

Oh, come back in three years. We’re going to put you on trial. Oh, Good.” You never see them by the way. Remember I had that debate with Joe Biden? He said, “No, they come back.” Yeah, they don’t come back. They don’t come back. No. They don’t come back. Like, never. Maybe 1%, but I doubt it. That’s the end of them.

They don’t like guns because it’s not painful enough. They like using knives. It’s true. They don’t like guns, they’d rather cut somebody up. To wreak havoc and terror upon innocent families. We’ve moved thousands and thousands of MS-13s the hell out of our country. We moved them back to where they came from. And some, we put in prison because they’re too dangerous to move back because they’ll try and figure away. They’re not stupid.

They want to make numerous places States, this way you have a lot more… Louie, you’re going to have a lot more company in Congress.

And I said, “Is there a way we can pay these people?” They never asked for anything, and their orchards were wiped out. One of the men said, “This was going to be the best crop I ever had. I was a week and a half away from finally, after 10, 12 years making some money.” And a week and a half early, he gets hit by the remnants of that big hurricane from Florida. Great state, great place. But you got hit. And David, we took 100% care of those people, right? We took 100% care, yeah, with the help of Sonny Purdue, Secretary of Agriculture.

And they want them to revolve up and down the court system so that Supreme Court Justices can spend time in other locations, down the totem pole.

We put on three… Think of this, three great Justices and we’ll be over 300 federal judges in the United States, which will be a record. Three hundred, 300. And they don’t want to wait, they want to do it very quickly. “Let’s just vote and we’ll take it.” This takes years and years and years to slowly change a court and perhaps I got a little bit lucky to get three.

We took it from the time I came in to the time we got hit and nobody’s blaming us for… Every country, 188 got hit. Some were totally devastated. I don’t know if they ever recover.

One of the world’s most overrated generals came to see me. He said, “Sir, we have no ammunition.” We had a little problem with a certain country. And he said, “Sir, we have no ammunition.” I said, “Tell me, you’re not saying that.” We didn’t have ammunition. Think of it. We had very little ammunition and I’ll never forget that statement. I said, “That should never happen to a president of the United States again nor should being spied on ever happened to a president of the United States again.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","53:10"
"Donald Trump","Senator Perdue has been a tremendous leader on pro-American immigration reform. Like nobody else. He voted very powerfully when I was going through hell on the wall. They would have given me anything. They gave me the money for the military. They just didn’t want to give me money for the wall. So I took it out of the military. What the hell could I do? That was rather good. It’s good to be a developer. Everyone said it was. That was the one where the judges ruled yesterday. So they said it was fine because I called it natural security. So we took it out of the… They didn’t figure that one out. Now they do. But you know what? They don’t have to be careful because it’s turned out to be very popular, very successful.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","53:45"
"Donald Trump","Shut down sanctuary cities. End chain migration and protect American jobs, David did. He voted to confirm nearly 300 of the judges that I talked about. The federal judges that interpret the constitution is written. And when the Democrat mob came for judge Kavanaugh, David Purdue stood strong. And I’m just thinking, they both stood strong when they impeached your president for making a perfect phone call too. I’m the only president ever will never… That got impeached for making a perfect phone call. But those two were among the best.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","54:20"
"Donald Trump","Senator Purdue is an outsider, a businessman, a great businessman, and a true American Patriot. You need him fighting for you and your family and your values because the United States Senate cannot be the same without him. So that’s why I’m here. I don’t do these things for other people. In fact, I was curious, I didn’t know if anyone was going to show up. I said, “I’m doing it for other people.” This is a hell of a crowd lift. As far as the eye can see. As far as the eye can see. I don’t like doing it for other people. I said, “David and Kelly called, would you do a rally?” I said, “Not really. I did 56 of them in a little tiny period of time.” I said, “Let me have…” And I said, when they asked I… It was really not. But I don’t do them for other people. It’s a lot of work to do a rally. A lot of work. People don’t realize. When you do… I did five a day, the last four or five days. One day I did six. Six. And the smallest one… Think of it, the smallest one.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","55:02"
"Donald Trump","And the smallest one, think of it, the smallest one at 25,000 people, you think that’s fun? In some of them it’s 75 degrees and another it’s 20 degrees below zero and you’re doing them both. I’m saying, “How’s the weather out there?” “Sir, it’s about 20 degrees below zero.” That’s good. Then I land the next step, “How are we doing?” “Sir, it’s 82.” David’s opponent Jon Ossoff is a radical left wing zealot who is very proud to be endorsed by Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie. Ossoff supports defunding the police, supports the crazy Green New Deal, that’s another beauty. Don’t forget, the Green New Neal is really $100 trillion, okay? It’s $100 trillion. They don’t say that, Louis, do they? Talk about 3 trillion? They got down to 3 trillion, no, it’s $100 trillion is what they wanted. That’s more money, if our economy was going unbelievable gangbusters for 100 years, no recession, no anything we couldn’t come close to making 100 trillion.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","56:03"
"Donald Trump","They want to rip down buildings and rebuild them with no windows. I like windows, I like big, beautiful windows. He wants to do a total government takeover of healthcare that will destroy your doctor’s offices and rural hospitals. So if you are sick, if you have a cold go to a hospital, wait on line for about three days and hope you get a decent doctor. Ossoff also supports a crippling nationwide lockdown. He wants you to lock your home nice and tight after you’re inside of it and he passes legislation to let hardened criminals go free, get them out of jail, get them out of jail. Ossoff will be a complete tool for the radical left donors who are trying to buy Georgia Senate seats.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","57:04"
"Donald Trump","You see the money these people have raised? I mean, well, of course I just raised $250 million and I should say. I didn’t raise it’s just… I said, how are we doing on that front? Because we didn’t get great publicity, boy, they were so happy these guys. You might not be happy in a few weeks, you might not. They were so happy. I said, “How’s fundraising going?” They said, “Sir, about 250 million.” I said, “250 million what?” “Dollars.” How the hell did that happen? Because people believe in what we’re doing, that’s why. They believe in what we’re doing. But that’s why Ossoff’s donations come from Silicon Valley, San Francisco and the other liberal places and they don’t come from Georgia. This is not your fault… I know you. You’re with me, I’m with you, we’ve always had wins from primers to two elections. We won two elections, believe it or not. I think I won the second one by more than I won the first one, I do, right? I won the second one by more.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","57:51"
"Donald Trump","On January 5th you also need to vote for your incredible Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler. Kelly has been an exceptional champion for Georgia’s workers and families. And I know what they fight for. If I could tell you about David, I could tell you about Kelly, she fights for you every single day, loves you state. When our nation was hit with the China virus, Senator Loeffler helped rescue the U.S. economy by voting to pass a historic $3 trillion bill relief for American workers and families that a lot of people were against it and turned out to be a great thing. Kelly, thank you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","59:03"
"Donald Trump","A lot of people said, “Oh, it’s too much.” I said, “It’s not their fault that I want to get them more money now.” And I like the higher number rather than the lower number, we’ll make it back. With our help we secured $15 billion for 175,000 Georgia small businesses and saved 1.5 million Georgia jobs, that was both of them really, both of them. Kelly is a relentless advocate for Georgia farmers and she is for tirelessly to get them relief in this pandemic. And by the way her husband is a fine man who’s one of the most respected men in the country, I want to tell you that. I want to tell you that. He’s a great man, he’s a great gentleman.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","59:44"
"Donald Trump","If you’re successful that it’s supposed to be a bad thing. No, I think it means you’re smart sometimes, right? He’s a smart guy but he’s a great guy, he’s a great man. At the urging of Kelly and David my administration took historic action to protect growers of Georgia blueberries, peppers, squash and cucumbers. Who does cucumbers around here? Because I like cucumbers. I’m the only one, I like cucumbers.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","01:00:28"
"Donald Trump","When our law enforcement heroes were under attack Senator Loeffler stood up to the Marxists and introduced legislation to protect our brave men and women in blue and she was threatened all over the place. That threat meant nothing. That was a wasted number of phone calls or however the hell they threatened you, that was a waste of time. She also introduced legislation to prevent Democrat gun grabbers like Beto O’Rouke. Remember Beto? Beto.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","01:00:54"
"Donald Trump","There’s a guy, here’s another one. He wants to take your guns away. Oh, by the way, Trump is going to lose Texas but Beto O’Rouke who’s a big factor of that all thing wants to take. Remember when Beto was running he was riding high and then Ted Cruz has done a great job, beat Beto O’Rouke. But Beto was riding high for a while. I remember he was on the cover of a certain really bad magazine, I won’t mention the name it’s failing. It won’t be in business for another six months, I don’t think, I hope. But he was on the cover and he said, “I was born to do this.” And I said, “Anybody that says they were born to do this they’re going to be losing very quickly.” And you know what? Within about two months he was a stone cold loser. And just weeks ago Senator Loeffler her vote to confirm our newest Supreme Court Justice, Amy Coney Barrett. They both did by the way, they both did. I can’t leave David out of that one.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","01:01:23"
"Donald Trump","Kelly’s opponent, Raphael Warnock is a dangerous extremist who is radically opposed to your values. He said he believes that, “Nobody can serve God and the military.” Oh, really? An appalling statement that dishonors the memory and generations of American heroes who fought for God and for our country. Raphael Warnock has openly declared his support for socialism and he is even praised Marxists all over the world. He once hosted the barbaric communist dictator, Fidel Castro. He likes Castro, he thinks he was a good man. “He was a good guy,” he said. He falsely slandered patriotic Americans as racist. He called police officers gangsters, thugs, and bullies.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","01:02:24"
"Donald Trump","He supports abolishing cash bail. Look at what happened to New York with their cash bail, no cash bail. Don’t bail, don’t worry about it. You killed somebody, don’t worry about it you’re on the honor code. And he’s declared, “Open up the jails.” Free the violent criminals and prey on Georgia families, children. Now you can’t do that. This is not for Georgia, yeah, I’m telling you. It might be for some places that I tell you that too, this is not for Georgia. I think Raphael has to move to another state.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","01:03:15"

Now, of course some of the fake news said, “Hundreds of people.” Again, no, no, tens of thousands of people. And Antifa, Antifa showed up. Not the right but the left showed up and they looked at some of these people and they wanted to attack the crowd. They looked and they said, “No, thank you,” and they left. No problem.

We’ll wait till we get the elderly people that want to stay in Washington and really just have a good time.” And it was disgusting to watch.

They want to say, “Oh, he doesn’t have to be a citizen.” You got to see what’s voting… They’re not citizens. “You’re a citizen?” “No, I’m not citizen.” “You speak English?” No, no English.

However, numerous whistleblowers are coming forward with credible information that hundreds of thousands of votes for President Trump mysteriously disappeared on election night. On Tuesday, Jesse Morgan, a worker for the U.S. Postal Service revealed that his trailer full of ballots simply went missing after he dropped them off. The worker drove his truck from Bethpage, New York, all the way to Lancaster, Pennsylvania and says he was carrying some 288,000 completed mail-in ballots.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","01:21:43"

The project is working to discover flaws and even expose cases of voting fraud in the 2020 election and has already uncovered serious examples of voting irregularities. Backing out President Trump’s warnings, Kline explains that the Post Office was rife with fraud and that many Postal Service workers were taking part in widespread illegal efforts to undermine the election.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","01:22:18"
"Pearson Sharp","While the missing truck full of ballots is bad enough, other whistleblowers say they drove thousands of prefilled ballots right over state lines, which is a federal crime. A subcontractor for the Post Office, Nathan Pease, said that he was told by two separate postal workers that the Post Office in Wisconsin had collected and backdated over 100,000 ballots on the morning after the election. Unsurprisingly others also claimed the integrity of Dominion voting machines has been compromised and cannot be trusted.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-rally-transcript-before-senate-runoff-elections-december-5","Donald Trump Georgia Rally Transcript Before Senate Runoff Elections December 5","01:22:49"

Kline says that in total there are over 300,000 fraudulent ballots in Arizona, 548,000 in Michigan, 204,000 in Georgia, and 121,000 in Pennsylvania.

So they had people and they’re voting, and then as you know, two of the canvassers were very brave. They didn’t vote, and they got the hell knocked out of them from the standpoint of what they went through.

In Georgia 0.5% of the mail-in ballots were rejected in 2020 compared to 5.77%. That’s a difference of 11 times more. It’s hundreds of thousands of votes.

In Arizona, a sample of 100 ballots reviewed by a judge found that a very small percentage of these ballots, very small, but when you look at it, it was turned out to be very large, it was tens of thousands of votes, more than we would have needed to win Arizona.
