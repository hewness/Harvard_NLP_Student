"Donald Trump","Well thank you very much, and thank you Gretchen. It’s great to be back in the incredible Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Great place. And this is my 13th visit to Pennsylvania during my administration, which is more than any other president to this point in the term. And I really love Pennsylvania, I went to school in Pennsylvania. Philadelphia. So we love this state, and I love the unions, and I love the workers.

"Donald Trump","And in the last really great election, our election of 2016, you know, we did great with the union workers, great. But we didn’t do good with the leadership. The leadership said, “Well, we’ve always gone Democrat. Let’s keep going that way.” That didn’t work out too well for some of them, I want to tell you. I’ll tell you, and as Gretchen said, this would have never happened without me and us. This would have never happened. So I’m with you. I’m with you. Remember that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-pennsylvania-speech-transcript-august-13-full-transcript","Donald Trump Pennsylvania Speech Transcript August 13: Full Transcript","03:13"

And we’re unleashing that power again like we’ve never seen before, I will say. And we are doing well, and we’re fighting against a lot of countries that have taken advantage of us for many, many years, but they’re not doing it so much anymore. And in a little period of time, they won’t be doing it at all anymore.

This shell petrochemical plant in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, I did very well here. We did very well. How many points did we win by? Does anybody know? I’ll tell you.

"Donald Trump","It’s one of the single biggest construction projects in the nation and it made it possible and was possible by clean, affordable, all American natural gas. Powerful, clean, natural gas. And when the wind stops blowing, it doesn’t make any difference does it? Unlike like those big windmills that destroy everybody’s property values, kill all the birds. Someday the environmentalists are going to tell us what’s going on with that. And then all of a sudden it stops, the wind, and the televisions go off. And your wives and husbands say, “Darling, I want to watch Donald Trump on television tonight, but the wind stopped blowing and I can’t watch, there’s no electricity in the house, Darling.”.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-pennsylvania-speech-transcript-august-13-full-transcript","Donald Trump Pennsylvania Speech Transcript August 13: Full Transcript","05:18"

It’s the largest investment in the history of Pennsylvania, in the history of our country, the money that’s being invested in your state right now. With your help, we’re not only unleashing American energy, we’re restoring the glory of American manufacturing, and we are reclaiming our noble heritage as a nation of builders again.

"Donald Trump","I was a good builder, I built it, I love building. In fact, I’m going to take a tour of the site. They said, “Sir, we were going to do it before the speech, but we’re waiting for it to stop raining.” I said, “Don’t worry about the rain. Do we have umbrellas?

"Donald Trump","When completed, this facility will transform abundant natural gas, and we have a lot of it, fracked from Pennsylvania wells, which they never would have allowed you to take if I weren’t president. If my opponent won, this would be a lot of nice new structures outside, I guess you would have stopped long ago. You would have stopped construction before it started too much. But I was talking to Gretchen, they would’ve never gotten the approvals to do what’s needed to fuel these plans. That wouldn’t have been good, so probably they wouldn’t have started, but if they would have started, it would have been stopped. But they put it into plastic through a process known as cracking. That raw material will then be shipped all over the country and all over the world to be fashioned into more products stamped with that very beautiful phrase, “Made in the USA.” Right? Made in the USA. Beautiful.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-pennsylvania-speech-transcript-august-13-full-transcript","Donald Trump Pennsylvania Speech Transcript August 13: Full Transcript","07:37"
"Donald Trump","That is a beautiful phrase. Getting this massive job done right, has required more than 1,500 pieces of heavy equipment, one of the largest cranes anywhere in the world. I look forward to seeing it, I love cranes. I love trucks of all types. Even when I was a little boy at four years old, my mother would say, “You love the trucks.” I do. I always loved trucks, I still do, nothing changes. Sometimes, you know, you might become president, but nothing changes, I still love trucks. Especially when I look at the largest crane in the world, that’s very cool. Do you think I’ll get to operate it? I don’t know. We’ll put the media on it and I’ll give then a little ride.

It was the Trump administration that made it possible, no one else. Without us, you would never have been able to do this. I want to thank all of our great union members, the boiler makers, carpenters, cement finishers, electricians, iron workers, laborers, millwrights, operators, plumbers, painters, steam fitters, I know them well.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-pennsylvania-speech-transcript-august-13-full-transcript","Donald Trump Pennsylvania Speech Transcript August 13: Full Transcript","09:46"
"Donald Trump","And a group that I’ve used more than anybody that’s ever run for office times a thousand. Because in New York City they would drive those cement trucks up to my building, and those trucks were always on time, and sometimes they were lined up for six blocks when I was doing different things. Even when I was doing the Wollman Rink the city couldn’t build, it took them nine years, they had no idea what they were doing. And I had that whole, big, about 70,000 feet. It’s like a massive office floor, bigger than an office. Look, we did it all in one day and the trucks were lined up from Central Park all the way back into Harlem. And they did it all in one day.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-pennsylvania-speech-transcript-august-13-full-transcript","Donald Trump Pennsylvania Speech Transcript August 13: Full Transcript","10:47"
"Donald Trump","That pour, it was called a contiguous pour, the city used to build little pieces, a little piece here, a little piece there, little piece here, little piece there. A few years later, a little piece here. Then they had pipes underneath, and the pipes were made out of copper. And during the evening things would happen, like the copper would be stolen because it was very valuable. So they’d have a little piece with copper and then the rest of the pipe they’d lay and they’d get ready to pour, and they’d leave and everybody would steal the copper. So they’d … this took place for … I guess from seven to nine years, nobody actually knows, nobody wants to talk about it. But those trucks were operated incredibly well and I never missed a delivery and it’s called the teamsters.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-pennsylvania-speech-transcript-august-13-full-transcript","Donald Trump Pennsylvania Speech Transcript August 13: Full Transcript","11:32"

It takes years, and years, and years to get a simple permit. It can take 20, 21 years to get a road before they reject it. How about this? They go 20 years, 21 years in certain cases for a highway or road, not even a highway. At the end of the 21st year they vote to reject it. How would you like to be, you’re a young person, you’re starting out, and you’re all excited about this project, and it starts off as being a simple straight road. And then it ends up being a total catastrophe. Because of nesting and lots of other things that we can take care of. And it’s 20 years later, and then they reject it. You’ve devoted half of your working life to a rejection. Happened to many people. And we have a man that knows how to break it up, but he’s also a great lover of the environment, EPA Administrator, Andrew Wheeler. He’s done an incredible job. Andrew, great job, Andre.

But Andrew, if we get them approved fast, we can increase our entire output. Texas is so big and is bigger, it turned out to be much bigger. I also got you ANWR in Alaska, which may be bigger than everything. And they couldn’t get it. Ronald Reagan couldn’t get it, no president could get it, and I got it approved and we’re all set.

And I put a little thing called a 25% tariff on all of the dump steel all over the country, and now your business is thriving.

We have to have a steel industry. We need steel for defense. What are we going to do? We have a little bit of a problem. We have a little bit of a conflict.

We didn’t have a new mill built in 30 years, and now we have many of them going up. Many car plants, they’re coming in from Japan. I told Prime Minister Abe, great guy.

They are building car plants now in the United States, in Michigan, in Pennsylvania, many, many of the Japanese car companies are coming over and building car plants in the United States. It doesn’t fully do the trip, but it helps. And those deficits will start coming down very substantially, but we’re losing 78 billion. For many years, we’re losing billions and billions with these countries, and frankly, the countries that we do the worst with are the allies, our allies. Does that make sense to you?

Think of it, lowest in 70 years, and I have to apologize to women, but soon we’re going to have that. That will be a record very soon. We’re very close to saying lowest in history for women unemployment. Today we have more workers working in the United States, almost 160 million, than at any time in the history of our country. Think of that. That’s a hell of a stat. The political class in Washington gutted your factories with horrendous trade deals, horrible. NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever. By the way, World Trade Organization, it made China, China made themselves, they did a good job, but they ripped off our country for years, and with our money and World Trade Organization backing, and then they took advantage of the rules of the World Trade Organization, and I’m being nice when I say took advantage.

So a lot of good things, and I think we will, I think they will treat us fairly. I mean the concept should work, but people have taken advantage. Like for instance, they view certain countries like China, India, many countries for a long time, they viewed them as they’re growing, right? They’re growing nations. We’re a mature nation.

I’d see these factories all over the country, and I’d see them empty, and I’d see the jobs going to other countries, and I just never understood why the politicians didn’t do anything about it. But now we’re doing it. And by the way, the USMCA, that’s Mexico and Canada, that deal is a fantastic deal, and it’s a great deal for your unions, too. We have the farmers, the unions, the manufacturers. It’s good for everybody. We have to get the Democrats to put it up for a vote, and most Democrats are going to vote for it, too. They’re under a lot of pressure to vote for it, but that replaces one of the worst trade deals ever made, which is NAFTA.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-pennsylvania-speech-transcript-august-13-full-transcript","Donald Trump Pennsylvania Speech Transcript August 13: Full Transcript","28:19"

But when you finally had the right person, the person that really cared … This thing is costing me a fortune, being president.

Under my administration, we’re fighting back, and we’re winning because we are truly and finally putting America first. After years of building up foreign countries, we are finally building up our country. Think of it, we protect the border of South Korea, but we don’t protect our own border. But now we are and the wall is being built. We won that case two weeks ago. We won that case. The wall is being … We’re going to have a lot of it. We’re going to have anywhere from 400 to 500 miles built by the end of next year. We’re building a lot of wall, and we need it. We need it. We want people to come into our country.

Remember, she wanted to close up all coal. She was in an area where they didn’t do the coal, and she said, “I look forward to closing up all coal. It’s going to be closed.

But it’s common sense, and a lot of this is, you know, they say politics, politics, great politics is common sense. But on my first day in office, I ended the war on American energy, and that’s common sense, I think. That’s common sense. We’re lucky. You go to places like China, they don’t have oil and gas.

It was good for others. It wasn’t for us. We had to pay money to other countries that are very substantial countries. They wanted to take away your wealth. They didn’t want you to drill.
