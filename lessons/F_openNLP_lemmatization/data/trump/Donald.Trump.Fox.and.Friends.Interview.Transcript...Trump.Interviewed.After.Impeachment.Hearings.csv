"Steve Doocy","Good to have you on Fox & Friends today. As you said in your tweet, another slow news week. Let’s start with the fact that … the story that Griff just brought us, and it sounds like a former FBI lawyer, it sounds like, was doing something with the FISA application. That person got removed. And this goes to your argument that somebody at the FBI was out to get you, right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-fox-and-friends-interview-transcript-trump-interviewed-after-impeachment-hearings","Donald Trump Fox and Friends Interview Transcript – Trump Interviewed After Impeachment Hearings","00:20"
"Donald Trump","Well, it certainly does. And they were spying on my campaign and it went right up to the top, and everybody knows it, and now we’re going to find out. You have Bull Durham, who is supposed to be the toughest. I’ve never met him, never spoke to him, but he’s supposed to be the smartest and the best, and he works for Bill Barr, who is a great Attorney General. We would maybe have ended this thing a lot sooner had he been there originally, but you have some people that are great people now, patriotic people, they love our country. And this was spying on my campaign, something that has never been done in the history of our country. This was an overthrow attempt at the presidency. They tried to overthrow the presidency. This is a disgrace, but I’m not surprised to see it. It’s just starting to come out, but I think this is nothing compared to what you’ll see over the next couple of weeks.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-fox-and-friends-interview-transcript-trump-interviewed-after-impeachment-hearings","Donald Trump Fox and Friends Interview Transcript – Trump Interviewed After Impeachment Hearings","00:45"

"Donald Trump","So my conversation was a perfect conversation. The Ukrainian president said, “What are they talking about? They must think we’re nuts in this country.” Because this conversation was flawless, it was appropriate, it was perfect, it was nice, it was everything. And they even said that. They came out and said it. Now, compare that and they try to impeach. And by the way, they’ve looked like fools over the last five days.

I wouldn’t have to, I could get very much involved, but I purposely don’t, and I haven’t, and you know what? It’s better that way, I guess. I don’t have any obligation legally to do that, but I’ve let them handle it. So you have a FISA report coming out, which the word is, it’s historic. That’s what the word is. That’s what I hear. And if it’s historic, you’re going to see something. And perhaps even more importantly, you have Durham coming out shortly thereafter. He’s the US Attorney, and he’s already announced it’s criminal.

"Donald Trump","Brennan, and for Clapper, and for all of these losers that you had over there, I think it’s impossible for them to being doing things. Let’s see what it all says, but it’s impossible. Susan Rice, the person that worked at the United Nations, who went after FISA reports and went after reports like she ate them for lunch. When you look at the previous administration, they went after a few, and she was getting them at levels that nobody’s even imagined before. It had nothing to do with her. No, I think this goes to the highest level. I hate to say it, I think it’s a disgrace. They thought I was going to win and they said, “How can we stop him?” They wrote up the phony, fake dossier, the disgusting fake dossier, and they tried to have it put out prior to the election, and just to show you how incompetent they were, they spent millions and millions of dollars. Hillary Clinton paid for it and the Democrats.

There’s tremendous corruption we’re looking for. Why should we be giving hundreds of millions of dollars to countries when there’s this kind of corruption? When you look at my call, I said corruption … I think he said it to me. He’s looking. He got elected on the basis of corruption. And I also, by the way, going back to that, why isn’t Germany putting up money? Why isn’t France putting up money? All the European nations, why aren’t they putting up?

You wouldn’t even believe this is possible, but the insurance policy, that was a very big find. Finding that text. And the only reason we found it was they didn’t want to use their private servers for a very bad reason, okay? So they used the public server. They used the FBI server. So here’s the thing.

Biden in the first debate said, “Oh, these are the wonderful people.” Sure, they’re wonderful people. We’re giving them 500 billion a year, 500 billion. That’s not including theft of intellectual property, etc. So I told President Xi, this can’t be an even deal, because we’re starting off from the floor and you’re already at the ceiling, so we have to have a much better deal.
