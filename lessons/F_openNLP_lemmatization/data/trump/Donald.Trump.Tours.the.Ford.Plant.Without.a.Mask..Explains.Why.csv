We had the capacity to do this. Nobody else did. So every state now has more than they need, and our stockpile is totally full. We have a tremendous amount. So now we’re really helping other countries where they’re losing a lot of people because they don’t have ventilators.

Every crisis is different, but what’s amazing is how our people responded. And this one, they didn’t wait to be asked to do something. They said, “Here’s an opportunity, and let’s go.” What I love about our culture is they didn’t ask for permission. They just went, and that’s something that we’ve done throughout our 117 year history, and I hope we’ll always do.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-tours-the-ford-plant-without-a-mask-explains-why","Donald Trump Tours the Ford Plant Without a Mask, Explains Why","07:10"

"President Donald Trump","By the way, here is my mask right here [crosstalk 00:07:44], and I liked it very much. I actually, honestly, I think I look better in the mask. I really did. I look better in the mask, [crosstalk 00:07:53] but I’m making a speech so I won’t have it now, but I did have it on right here. And I think some of you might’ve gotten a shot.

"Mr. Lester","If you walk around here, you can see the respirator. It just holds the respirator, so. On the first day when we had this conversation, in the drawing, we said how do we use automotive components to go quick? And so we got about a fan of a highly controlled seat in the F150. We take a battery pack off of a Dewalt tool from the battery source, and then a filter to filter the air for the occupant.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-tours-the-ford-plant-without-a-mask-explains-why","Donald Trump Tours the Ford Plant Without a Mask, Explains Why","08:29"

We’ve never had an empty seat since the day I came down the escalator with our future First Lady, we’ve never had an empty seat. You know that. And we’d have thousands of people we sent away. And I think the demand now from what we see is greater than ever before. We’re going to have to go to certain states where we’re able to… Look, I don’t want to have a stadium where you’re supposed to have a person and then seven empty seats and then another person.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-tours-the-ford-plant-without-a-mask-explains-why","Donald Trump Tours the Ford Plant Without a Mask, Explains Why","11:48"

We’ll go to a place like maybe Georgia, some other place where they’re going to be opening up. Whoever opens up first. The demand has been incredible to get going with the rallies. I just hear the music in the background. I’m saying we’ve had rallies like nobody’s ever had, and we would love to get back to that.

"President Donald Trump","I think it holds tremendous promise, but we have many other companies who are just about as far along. We have many companies. We have the greatest pharmaceutical companies in the world. They’re equally, you know what I mean? They’re really in a position and I’m not only talking about vaccine. I’m talking about cures and therapeutics. Therapeutically, we have some things coming out which we think are going to be great, but they have to be tested quickly. And we’re doing it very quickly.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-tours-the-ford-plant-without-a-mask-explains-why","Donald Trump Tours the Ford Plant Without a Mask, Explains Why","13:00"

"President Donald Trump","Right now, what we’re doing is we’re setting logistically with our military, our military is in gear so that we can give 150, 200 million shots quickly. The military is in gear. We can move a couple of hundred thousand soldiers immediately in time of emergency. So this is not nearly as big a deal is that it’s equally as important perhaps, but it’s not as tough logistically.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-tours-the-ford-plant-without-a-mask-explains-why","Donald Trump Tours the Ford Plant Without a Mask, Explains Why","13:31"

"President Donald Trump","I’ll sit down with a lot of people and we’ll figure it out. We’re going to sit down with the military and we hope to be in that position fairly soon. So rather than having the vaccine, doing the tests and then starting to gear up, we’re taking a risk. Because you know, it could be that if something happened, but I don’t think that’s going to be. But in addition to that company, we have other companies that are very far advanced. And also don’t forget, therapeutics and cure. We’re talking about a vaccine in this case, but therapeutics and cure.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-tours-the-ford-plant-without-a-mask-explains-why","Donald Trump Tours the Ford Plant Without a Mask, Explains Why","14:03"

"President Donald Trump","I think they’re doing a good job, a really good job in a very complex situation. You know, we started off, nobody knew what the virus was. It came in from China and nobody knew what it was. And frankly, I think they’ve done a really good job. I’m very happy about it. A lot of other people think they’ve done a lot of great work. We’re now up to, and this is beyond even CDC, because we’ve done it between Jared Cushner and a lot of geniuses coming in from Silicon Valley, and a lot of people, these companies where they could make ventilators.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-tours-the-ford-plant-without-a-mask-explains-why","Donald Trump Tours the Ford Plant Without a Mask, Explains Why","14:48"
"President Donald Trump","Look, what we did with ventilators is incredible because we geared up in a short period of time through General Electric, Ford, they’re represented here at the top level, through other companies. We were at Honeywell the other day. They make masks. Who would think Honeywell is making a mask? But that’s what they’re making now is a mask. It’s a very high tech company. You know, they make the dashboards to an airplane and lots of other things. And now they’re making masks. Our companies geared up so quickly, so fast. Honeywell opened a plant in three weeks from literally zero to open making masks in three weeks. It’s been an incredible achievement.

We know that older people are affected gravely, and younger people are not affected gravely, frankly. You look at the statistics. It’s incredible. And we know that we have to protect some people much more so. I think a lot of the governors have done a very, very poor job on nursing homes, but they’ve done a good job on other things. I know every governor. I can grade every governor. But we’ve made a lot of hero governors. We’ve done a great job for the governors and my relationship with them in almost all cases is very good.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-tours-the-ford-plant-without-a-mask-explains-why","Donald Trump Tours the Ford Plant Without a Mask, Explains Why","16:21"

"President Donald Trump","I think that a lot of these states are going to, the ones that are sort of sticking to a certain very rigid pattern, I think they’re going to stop. I don’t think that people are going to stand for it. This is a country that’s meant to be open, not closed. And we did the right thing, John. We saved millions of lives, millions and millions of lives. You would have had anywhere from a million five to two million, five, three million lives, think of it. So if we were at a hundred thousand, instead of a hundred thousand, multiply that times 15, 20 or 25, it wouldn’t have been acceptable. It wouldn’t have been sustainable. You couldn’t have done it. So we’ve called it right, and now I want it open and we’re going to open.
