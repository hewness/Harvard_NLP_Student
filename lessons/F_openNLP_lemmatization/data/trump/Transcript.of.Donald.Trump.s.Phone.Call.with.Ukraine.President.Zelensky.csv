"situation that we were able to achieve a unique success. I’m able to tell you the following;
the first time, you called me to  congratulate me when I won my
presidential election, and the second time you are now calling
me when my party won the parliamentary election. I think I
should run more often so you can call me more often and we can
talk over the phone more often.",NA,"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-of-donald-trumps-phone-call-with-ukraine-president-zelensky","Transcript of Donald Trump’s Phone Call with Ukraine President Zelensky","timed text issue"

"speaking to Angela Merkel she talks Ukraine, but she doesn’t do
anything. A lot of the European countries are the same way so I
think it’s something you want to look at but the United States
has been very very good to Ukraine. I wouldn’t say that it’s
reciprocal necessarily because things are happening
that are not good but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine.",NA,"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-of-donald-trumps-phone-call-with-ukraine-president-zelensky","Transcript of Donald Trump’s Phone Call with Ukraine President Zelensky","timed text issue"

"call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney
General. Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very
capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great. The
former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad
news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad
news so I just want to let you know that. The other thing,
There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the
prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so
whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.
Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if
you can look into it… It sounds horrible to me.",NA,"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-of-donald-trumps-phone-call-with-ukraine-president-zelensky","Transcript of Donald Trump’s Phone Call with Ukraine President Zelensky","timed text issue"

"I also wanted to thank you for your invitation to visit
the United States, specifically Washington DC. On the other
hand, I also want to ensure you that we will be very serious
about the case and will work on the investigation. As to the
economy, there is much potential for our two countries and one
of the issues. that is very important for Ukraine is energy
independence. I believe we can be very successful. and
cooperating on energy independence with United States. We are
already working on cooperation. We are buying American oil but I
am very hopeful for a future meeting. We will have more time and
more opportunities to discuss these opportunities and get to
know each other better. I would like to thank you very much for
your support.",NA,"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-of-donald-trumps-phone-call-with-ukraine-president-zelensky","Transcript of Donald Trump’s Phone Call with Ukraine President Zelensky","timed text issue"

"to invite you to visit Ukraine and come to the
city bf Kyiv which is a beautiful city. We have a beautiful
country which would welcome you. On the other hand, I believe
that on September I we will be in Poland and we can meet in
Poland hopefully. After that, it might be a very good idea for
you to travel to Ukraine. We can either take my plane and go to
Ukraine or we can take your plane, which is probably much better
than mine.",NA,"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-of-donald-trumps-phone-call-with-ukraine-president-zelensky","Transcript of Donald Trump’s Phone Call with Ukraine President Zelensky","timed text issue"
