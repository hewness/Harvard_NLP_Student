"President Donald Trump","Well, thank you very much, and congratulations on 10 years on radio. Wow, that’s pretty good. I remember when you were one day on radio. It’s been a long time, but that’s great job. You’re doing a great job, Brian.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-radio-interview-transcript-admits-going-to-bunker-during-protests-but-was-for-an-inspection","Donald Trump Radio Interview Transcript: Admits Going to Bunker During Protests, But Was for an ‘Inspection’","00:06"

"Brian Kilmeade","… and I got the number one job in the country. I just was curious, the place you used to live where the mayor, Mayor de Blasio, the National Guard is not going to work here. They’re not trained to handle unrest. Do you agree with that?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-radio-interview-transcript-admits-going-to-bunker-during-protests-but-was-for-an-inspection","Donald Trump Radio Interview Transcript: Admits Going to Bunker During Protests, But Was for an ‘Inspection’","00:25"
"President Donald Trump","No. Not at all. If you look at what happened in Minnesota, they were getting decimated, and after three days of watching it, I demanded that the National Guard be utilized, and in one day, it was over. In fact, they got there at a certain time in the late afternoon, and by the time they finished, it was, I always say a somewhat sarcastically, but the safest place on earth to… and Minnesota was really, really having a hard time, and we took care of it. The governor is a nice man, and he was not using enough, and he was… You saw the police were running in Minneapolis, and they were running away from their precinct, which is something I’ve never seen before.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-radio-interview-transcript-admits-going-to-bunker-during-protests-but-was-for-an-inspection","Donald Trump Radio Interview Transcript: Admits Going to Bunker During Protests, But Was for an ‘Inspection’","00:39"
"President Donald Trump","You have a liberal mayor that, frankly, was having a lot of trouble, and you have a very liberal mayor in New York too. Do you notice that all of these places that have problems are not run by Republicans, they’re run by Liberal Democrats, so there is something into that philosophy, and yet they’re also the ones keeping everybody locked up in their apartments and their homes for too long a period of time, so it’s very interesting how that changes, but no, the National Guard, we could solve that problem in New York, and in fact, if they don’t get their act straightened out, I will solve it. I’ll solve it fast.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-radio-interview-transcript-admits-going-to-bunker-during-protests-but-was-for-an-inspection","Donald Trump Radio Interview Transcript: Admits Going to Bunker During Protests, But Was for an ‘Inspection’","01:18"
"Brian Kilmeade","Last night was one of the best nights in day eight, especially in New York. We didn’t see the riots. We saw the protests. Even though it wasn’t perfect, do you think we’ve turned the corner according to the reports you get?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-radio-interview-transcript-admits-going-to-bunker-during-protests-but-was-for-an-inspection","Donald Trump Radio Interview Transcript: Admits Going to Bunker During Protests, But Was for an ‘Inspection’","01:52"
"President Donald Trump","Well, you may, but you still had a lot of people, and they’re violent people in many cases. You have protesters, but you also have anarchists and looters. A lot of people that are bad people. A lot of bad people. We have a lot of proof and information and proof. You’ll be seeing it in time to come where they’re delivering rocks and stones to certain locations and dumping them, so they have… That’s their ammunition, and that hurts people very badly, including National Guard people or even military people.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-radio-interview-transcript-admits-going-to-bunker-during-protests-but-was-for-an-inspection","Donald Trump Radio Interview Transcript: Admits Going to Bunker During Protests, But Was for an ‘Inspection’","02:05"
"President Donald Trump","But Washington is in great shape. We called out the National Guard after the first night, which was a little bit rougher, but then after that, we called up, and we have, I jokingly said, a little bit jokingly maybe, it’s one of the safest places on earth. We had no problem all last night. We had substantial dominant force, and we have to have a dominant force. Maybe it doesn’t sound good to say it, but you have to have a dominant force. We need law and order.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-radio-interview-transcript-admits-going-to-bunker-during-protests-but-was-for-an-inspection","Donald Trump Radio Interview Transcript: Admits Going to Bunker During Protests, But Was for an ‘Inspection’","02:41"
"Brian Kilmeade","Sunday wasn’t the case. We had Leland Vittert reporting no problem. It got dark, a huge problem. He was attacked. Then the reports were, they were so worried, they brought you downstairs in the White House to a bunker. What could you tell me Sunday night was like for you and your family?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-radio-interview-transcript-admits-going-to-bunker-during-protests-but-was-for-an-inspection","Donald Trump Radio Interview Transcript: Admits Going to Bunker During Protests, But Was for an ‘Inspection’","03:11"
"President Donald Trump","Well, it was a false report. I wasn’t down. I went down during the day, and I was there for a tiny little short period of time, and it was much more for an inspection. There was no problem during the day. The problem, I saw Leland got whacked pretty good, but that was during the night. This problem, these problems are during the night, not during the day. I go down, I’ve gone down two or three times all for inspection. You go there… Someday you may need it, but you go there, and I went down, I looked at it, it was during the day. It was not a problem. I read about it like a big thing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-radio-interview-transcript-admits-going-to-bunker-during-protests-but-was-for-an-inspection","Donald Trump Radio Interview Transcript: Admits Going to Bunker During Protests, But Was for an ‘Inspection’","03:27"
"President Donald Trump","There was never a problem. We never had a problem. Nobody ever came close to giving us a problem. The Secret Service does an unbelievable job of maintaining control in the White House, and beyond the Secret Service, we have a lot of other great people out there, including the DC Police, and then of course, on top of that, after I saw the one evening, which was a little rough, and it was certainly a rough on Leland I think more so than anybody else, we brought in the troops.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-radio-interview-transcript-admits-going-to-bunker-during-protests-but-was-for-an-inspection","Donald Trump Radio Interview Transcript: Admits Going to Bunker During Protests, But Was for an ‘Inspection’","04:06"
"Brian Kilmeade","Mr. President, I remember 9/11 that President Bush wanted to land back at Washington. They wouldn’t let him. They said, “It’s too dangerous.” Finally got it back there. Sometimes the Secret Service even tells the president, “I can’t do this.” You telling me, Mr. President, they didn’t say to you, “You have to go downstairs. My responsibility’s your welfare.” They didn’t limit you at all in the House?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-radio-interview-transcript-admits-going-to-bunker-during-protests-but-was-for-an-inspection","Donald Trump Radio Interview Transcript: Admits Going to Bunker During Protests, But Was for an ‘Inspection’","04:38"
"President Donald Trump","Nope. They didn’t tell me that at all, but they said, “It would be a good time to go down, take a look because maybe sometime you’re going to need it.” I’ve been down, let’s see, that would be number two, two and a half sort of because I’ve done different things, but two and a half, but I looked, I was down for a very, very short period of time, very, very short period of time. I can’t tell you who went with me, but a whole group of people went with me as a inspecting factor.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-radio-interview-transcript-admits-going-to-bunker-during-protests-but-was-for-an-inspection","Donald Trump Radio Interview Transcript: Admits Going to Bunker During Protests, But Was for an ‘Inspection’","04:59"
"President Donald Trump","I was back up, and Brian, it was during the day. It wasn’t during the night. I think they reported during the night. During the night, maybe someday it makes sense. During the day, you have tremendous numbers of people. We didn’t even have protesters, or if they did, it was a small crowd. There’s so much fake news going around, Brian, you have no idea. Maybe you do actually have an idea.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-radio-interview-transcript-admits-going-to-bunker-during-protests-but-was-for-an-inspection","Donald Trump Radio Interview Transcript: Admits Going to Bunker During Protests, But Was for an ‘Inspection’","05:28"
"Brian Kilmeade","Mr. President, you gave a speech in the Rose Garden, got a thumbs up for a lot of people, especially your supporters, and then you said, “I’m going to go to a very important place,” and they quickly cleared out Lafayette Park, and you walk through with many of your staff, from Kayleigh McEnany to the Secretary of Defense who said he didn’t know where he was going at the time, and you appear to St. John’s Church, which was boarded up and you held up a Bible. Reverend James Martin, a Jesuit priest and author of a book on that church says, “The church is not a photo op, that religion is not a political tool, and God is not a play thing.” He’s among some religious leaders who were very critical of that visit. What’s your response?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-radio-interview-transcript-admits-going-to-bunker-during-protests-but-was-for-an-inspection","Donald Trump Radio Interview Transcript: Admits Going to Bunker During Protests, But Was for an ‘Inspection’","05:51"
"President Donald Trump","Well, my response is simple: Most religious leaders loved it. I heard Franklin Graham this morning thought it was great. I heard many other people think it was great. It’s only the other side that didn’t like it, the opposition party as the expression goes. They burned down the church the day before. I heard how nice and wonderful the protesters were over there.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-radio-interview-transcript-admits-going-to-bunker-during-protests-but-was-for-an-inspection","Donald Trump Radio Interview Transcript: Admits Going to Bunker During Protests, But Was for an ‘Inspection’","06:33"
"President Donald Trump","Really? Then why did they burn down the church today before… They burned down a big section of it. Fortunately, they were able to catch it in time. This is a church built at a similar time as the White House. Madison was your president. He was number six, I believe. Madison was your president, and he was the first president to enter and go to that church.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-radio-interview-transcript-admits-going-to-bunker-during-protests-but-was-for-an-inspection","Donald Trump Radio Interview Transcript: Admits Going to Bunker During Protests, But Was for an ‘Inspection’","06:53"
"President Donald Trump","Now, when I said go to the church, I didn’t know protesters or not. Nobody tells me that. They say, “Yes, sir, we’ll go to the church.” We walked over to the church. It was very fast. I think it was very symbolic. I did hold up a Bible. I think that’s a good thing, not a bad thing, and many religious leaders loved it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-radio-interview-transcript-admits-going-to-bunker-during-protests-but-was-for-an-inspection","Donald Trump Radio Interview Transcript: Admits Going to Bunker During Protests, But Was for an ‘Inspection’","07:14"
"President Donald Trump","As to… If you read Mollie Hemingway, who I know you’re a fan of and I’m a big fan of, she wrote a piece that it was all fake news. There’s so much fake news. Most news is fake. They’re corrupt, and they’re fake, the lamestream media. If you read the story and if you read what Mollie Hemingway said, who’s a real reporter, a great journalist, you’ll see that that story was fake. They didn’t use tear gas. They didn’t use… They moved them out.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-radio-interview-transcript-admits-going-to-bunker-during-protests-but-was-for-an-inspection","Donald Trump Radio Interview Transcript: Admits Going to Bunker During Protests, But Was for an ‘Inspection’","07:31"
"President Donald Trump","Now, when I went, I didn’t say, “Oh, move them out.” I didn’t know who was there. I figured I was going to walk over the church very nearby. If you read the Mollie Hemingway piece, you’ll get the real story, but most religious leaders loved it. Why wouldn’t they love it? I’m standing in front of a church that went through trauma, to put it mildly. I mean, the whole basement, a big part of the basement was burning. It’s very lucky that church didn’t burn down. That’s a very important church, so I haven’t heard-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-radio-interview-transcript-admits-going-to-bunker-during-protests-but-was-for-an-inspection","Donald Trump Radio Interview Transcript: Admits Going to Bunker During Protests, But Was for an ‘Inspection’","07:58"

"Brian Kilmeade","Mr. President, was the original intent to go inside and see the damage, and did you notice it was boarded up when you got there?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-radio-interview-transcript-admits-going-to-bunker-during-protests-but-was-for-an-inspection","Donald Trump Radio Interview Transcript: Admits Going to Bunker During Protests, But Was for an ‘Inspection’","08:28"
"President Donald Trump","No, they told me it was boarded up, and I said, “That’s all right. We’ll stand by the church. We won’t go inside.” It had received a very bad burning. I would have been able to go inside if I wanted to, but it was boarded up. The whole building was just about boarded up, but I would have been able to go in, but there’s no reason for it. It was smoke, a lot of smoke and a lot of damage, actually, a lot of damage, but it was confined to one area. The fire itself was confined to one area. But Brian, the church leaders loved that I went there with a Bible. I mean, take a look at Franklin Graham, so respected, and so many others. Take a look at Robert Jeffress. These are all people you know.

We’ve done a great job, but we don’t get credit for it, but hopefully, the people understand.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-radio-interview-transcript-admits-going-to-bunker-during-protests-but-was-for-an-inspection","Donald Trump Radio Interview Transcript: Admits Going to Bunker During Protests, But Was for an ‘Inspection’","09:34"

That speech was written for him because he doesn’t speak like that. But here’s the thing. He did a crime bill that was a disaster. What he did with Clarence Thomas was a disaster. It was a disaster, the way he treated Clarence Thomas, a black man, a great justice as it turns out, but go back to those horrible days the way he treated Clarence Thomas. They write books about it.

He used to be, it used to be the G8, and Obama got taken over to cleaners. I mean, Obama had his pockets picked, and as you know, Putin did something that he shouldn’t have done because he didn’t respect Obama perhaps, and Obama got upset, and the United States said, “We don’t want to be here.
