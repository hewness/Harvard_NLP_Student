"Dave Portnoy","And here’s part of it, I hate politics, my dad loves politics. The thing that drives me nuts is I feel like for us, which is good, they’re like, “Hey Dave, you’re a snowflake.” “Hey Dave, you’re a conservative, white, crazy person.” And almost on each side, you can predict what somebody is going to say, which drives me nuts. It’s like you put it in a box. So one of the things that I’ve been thinking about, and for all the people like me, which I think a good amount of the country is still like, “Which way am I going to vote?” One of the things that I have a question for, and again, I think it matters. I’m very curious on the answer.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-david-portnoy-of-barstool-sports","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports","02:08"
"Dave Portnoy","When the Kaepernick thing started, I was critical of it. And as it’s continued, baseball players now, I heard you say, if they kneel, you’ll turn the game off. And we’ve got the Black Lives Matter protests, so for me, how does somebody who’s dissatisfied, in your world, what’s the way for them to show it? Because we don’t want them looting and doing all the stuff they’re doing. To me, that’s a silent protest that is far better than going out on the streets and create crime. So I’m curious, what would you do if you had an issue with the country or something to show your displeasure?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-david-portnoy-of-barstool-sports","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports","02:38"
"Donald Trump","Well, I mean, you can always say you run for office, right? You become successful. You could run for a lower office, you can do things, but there are ways. You get groups together and there can be very friendly ways of doing it, very successful. I mean, you’re going to have negative rebounds if it keeps up the way it is. As an example of Portland, this is crazy. 51 days, we sent in very powerful, not military but very strong people. The police are good but they were told not to do anything by the radical left mayor. Now you have to go out and speak your mind. I think speaking your mind is good, but you have to do it fairly. We are for justice, but we’re for law and order. It’s got to be law and order, and there is law and order.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-david-portnoy-of-barstool-sports","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports","03:11"
"Donald Trump","I put something out when they were starting to rip down statues. I went out, I found an old law, an old bill, you couldn’t get it passed today. You get 10 years in jail. 10 years and no games, and we have a lot of people in jail right now. If you ripped down a federal statue, because the states have to take care of their own, unfortunately, because I’d do that too, but you rip down a federal statue you get 10 years in jail. 10 years, no three months, and nothing’s happened since then. It was amazing. I signed it. I had a news conference. I said, “If you do it …” And we were supposed to have thousands of people march on Washington that day, nobody showed up.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-david-portnoy-of-barstool-sports","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports","03:55"
"Dave Portnoy","How do we close the divide? At my age it just seems half the country hates the other half, and no matter what you say, they can’t get along.

That you’re like a lightning rod.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-david-portnoy-of-barstool-sports","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports","04:33"

"Donald Trump","I think it was happening, and then we got hit by the China Virus. I think it was happening, success. Our country never did better. The best employment numbers in the history of our country. Best unemployment numbers, African American, Asian, American, Hispanic American, everybody, best unemployment numbers in history, Best stock market we’ve ever had. Although I must tell you, as you know probably very well, the stock market is almost at the same level right now, which a great tribute.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-david-portnoy-of-barstool-sports","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports","04:53"

"Donald Trump","A lot of things are happening. Great housing numbers the other day, great everything. We’re doing really well. We’re trying to get rid of the rest of this pandemic, but success does it, and we were ready to do it. Because if you look at, when you say Hispanic, or when you say African American, Asian American, they were all working. Everybody was making a lot of money. Everybody was doing good, and it was coming together, and then China sent us this horrible, bad present, a real bad present. They could have stopped it. They should’ve stopped it. We made a trade deal with China, and it was a great deal, but it means much less to me now than it did then, because I’m not happy with what they’ve done to the world. They stopped it going into China from Wuhan, but they didn’t stop it going into Europe, the United States and the rest of the world.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-david-portnoy-of-barstool-sports","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports","05:29"
"Donald Trump","But we were ready to do it, and the word is success, and I think we’re going to have that. I think we’re going to have a great next year. You’ll be able to see the results before the election, which is interesting because the election is November 3rd, at the beginning of November, the numbers are going to come out for the third quarter. I predict those numbers are going to be really great, despite the fact that Democrats want to keep their areas closed because they want the numbers to be bad.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-david-portnoy-of-barstool-sports","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports","06:19"

"Dave Portnoy","I don’t know whether a Black Lives Matter person would be like, “Well, the economy, great, but we still want the president to come out, whether it be Twitter or whatever, and have our back.” So that’s where the kneeling and things like that seems like such a small concession, and the thing to be like, “Yep, Donald’s our guy.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-david-portnoy-of-barstool-sports","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports","06:56"

Now the number one energy producer in the world, and there’s nobody even close. I’ve been very tough with Russia. I mean, China, nobody’s been tough like me with China.

But we don’t do that with Twitter. We put it out instantaneously. We feel great, and then you start getting phone calls, “Did you really say this?” I say, “What’s wrong with that?” And you find a lot of things. You know what I find?

And in that one case, I mean, I looked at a couple of cases, if you have diabetes, if you have problems with something, but the kids are in great shape. So we want to open the schools and we’re opening the country. We had great numbers announced the other day. And two weeks ago, we had the biggest number of jobs we’ve ever had. And the month before that, we had the same thing. A lot of good things are happening, and I think it looks like a V. We have a lot of people that would like to see their states closed. I have a feeling on November 4th, they’ll open them up.

"Dave Portnoy","I’m sure you’ve been asked this. It’s one of the questions that I had when I was thinking of what I would ask you here, because you theoretically, for somebody like me, who’s sports, entertainment, having fun, you had the dream life, seemingly. And there’s a part of me that’s like, “I wonder if he ever,” and I know the answer is going to be no, “Regrets it.” Because now, I mean, you’re the most famous person in the world. My guess is nobody ever said, “Hey, I don’t like Donald Trump before he became president,” but now everyone has an opinion and your life has changed forever when seemingly you had the dream life beforehand.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-david-portnoy-of-barstool-sports","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports","14:49"
"Donald Trump","I was in so many rap songs, like 79 or something. I was in every rap. This is before I did this, right? It’s a very interesting thing that you say, because the best day in my life in terms of business and life and everything was the day before I announced I’m running for president. Everything was good. The company was good. I had finished up a lot of jobs that were very successful, and then I said, “I want to do this.” Now, I’m really glad I did, but I was treated very unfairly with fake Russia. Russia, Russia, Russia. Ukraine, Ukraine, all fake stuff. It’s a very vicious business.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-david-portnoy-of-barstool-sports","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports","15:19"

It’s the toughest to deal with.” When you look at what I have to do, I have to focus on the big picture, but I also have to focus … I have so many people on the left or call them Democrats, call them whatever you want, and then you look at what they’re doing with cities. Every city is run by a liberal Democrat and they’re going to hell, and we have to do something. We just sent people into Chicago. We sent people into Portland, as we said. We’re sending people into New York to help out. It’s incredible, but I love doing it. There was this phony deal that I was devastated when I won, because I couldn’t have my life.

And my wife looked at me, she said, “I hear people booing.” And she was with me for a long time. We’ve been together a long time. She said, “Some people are booing.” I said, “Yeah, but some people were also clapping wildly.” She said, “You know what, I’ve been with you a long time, I’ve never heard anyone boo you.” This was right after I started being the politician.

And that’s a very different thing for the president. I mean, I’m the president of Barstool, but people would say, is it presidential? Is it not? And you just do your thing and it wins. I wondered that. Here’s a hypothetical, if the perfect candidate, let’s not say Republican, Democrat, came along and said, “If we make him president, this country is going to be prosperous, everyone will get along.” Would you step aside?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-interview-transcript-with-david-portnoy-of-barstool-sports","Donald Trump Interview Transcript With Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports","17:39"
