"Donald Trump","Today I’m honored to sign a proclamation celebrating August 18th, 2020 as the 100th anniversary of the 19th amendment. In the summer of 1848, Elizabeth Cady Stanton stood before the first ever women’s rights convention in Seneca Falls, New York, and declared that women should enjoy this fundamental civil right. What a job she did. Seven decades later, the suffrage movement succeeded. On this day in 1920, the United States ratified the 19th amendment. It was a monumental victory for equality, for justice, and a monumental victory for America. Today, a record-breaking 131 women are serving in Congress, nearly 70 million women vote in elections, 56% of our nation’s college students are women, more than 11 million women own successful businesses. In other words, women dominate the United States. I think we can say that very strongly.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-18-100th-anniversary-of-ratification-of-19th-amendment","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 18: 100th Anniversary of Ratification of 19th Amendment","03:35"
"Donald Trump","Before the China virus set in and struck our nation, women had gained 4.3 million jobs, a record, the women’s unemployment rate had plummeted to the lowest level in more than 65 years, and last year, over 70% of the new jobs went to women. And I will say, we’re coming back very strongly and we’re going to see those numbers again very soon. But the numbers that we have for unemployment and employment, frankly, we had 160 million people working. We’ve never even been close to that, and by next year we’ll be even higher than that number. Tremendous things are happening.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-18-100th-anniversary-of-ratification-of-19th-amendment","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 18: 100th Anniversary of Ratification of 19th Amendment","04:48"
"Donald Trump","As we fight to deliver a better future for all women and for all Americans, we remember the wonderful victory one century ago. While I am president, America will always honor its heroes and we will always celebrate the patriots who secured women’s right to vote. So this is an incredible document that I’m signing, and I wanted to just add something because this was brought up a week ago and I was so surprised that it was never done before, because later today I will be signing a full and complete pardon for Susan B. Anthony. She was never pardoned.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-18-100th-anniversary-of-ratification-of-19th-amendment","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 18: 100th Anniversary of Ratification of 19th Amendment","05:25"

"Donald Trump","We’ll talk about that later. We will talk about that the Democrats want to make it a political issue. It’s not a political issue. It’s really about a correct vote. You have to get voting right. You can’t have millions and millions of ballots sent all over the place, sent to people that are dead, sent to dogs, cats, sent everywhere. This is a serious situation. This isn’t games, and you have to get it right. I just want to get it right. Win, lose, or draw. I think we’re going to win.

"Donald Trump","Well, they’re going to do something in Congress, but everything they do is political. As an example, why don’t they do it now instead of on Monday? They picked a day. Actually, they picked another day on Monday, as you know. Well, that’s when the Republican Convention starts. Why don’t they do it during the Democrat Convention? Because everything they do, Nancy and Chuck, they play games. How’s it working out? I think this is the White House, isn’t it? How’s it working out for them? Not so good.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-18-100th-anniversary-of-ratification-of-19th-amendment","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 18: 100th Anniversary of Ratification of 19th Amendment","10:33"
"Donald Trump","So I will tell you, it’s disgraceful. It’s disgraceful. We have to have honest voting. That’s what this is all about here. It’s honest voting. You can’t take millions of ballots, send them haphazardly all over the country or all over a state, and expect to come out properly. And if you look at the last 10 elections where they did this universal … And by the way, absentee is great. It’s been working for a long time, like in Florida. Absentee, you request and it comes in, and then you send it back. Absentee is great, but universal is going to be a disaster the likes of which our country has never seen. It’ll end up being a rigged election or they will never come out with an outcome. They’ll have to do it again and nobody wants that. And I don’t want that. Go ahead, please. Let’s talk about this subject, however. Although, indirectly, we’re probably talking about the same subject.

"Cleta Mitchell","Well, I do have an opinion. The president is right. One of the things that the Democrats and their allies in the media and the left have been trying to do for a long time is to have universal mail voting where election officials send ballots to everybody on the registration list. But we all know there have been multiple studies, the Pew study, millions of people are on the rolls who are no longer living there, they’re dead, they’re non-citizens. Don’t forget, when you go to the DMV or social services, they ask you … They’re supposed to. By law, they have to ask you to register to vote, whether you’re eligible or not. All of those registrations are dumped into the system, and so there are duplicates. I am chairman of a public interest legal foundation. We’re devoted to election integrity and we just did a study of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. We found one man with seven active registrations. If you send him seven ballots, there’s the potential to vote seven times.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-18-100th-anniversary-of-ratification-of-19th-amendment","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 18: 100th Anniversary of Ratification of 19th Amendment","12:12"
"Donald Trump","He will.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-18-100th-anniversary-of-ratification-of-19th-amendment","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 18: 100th Anniversary of Ratification of 19th Amendment","13:08"
"Cleta Mitchell","So the issue is … I actually have a memo I’m working on to give to the president about what the post office should be doing. They should be working with local election officials. They should be making sure that the ballots are designed in a way that processes properly through the voting equipment, through the post office equipment. Everybody is focused on this situation with somehow the Postal Service, that the president is somehow trying to do something to the Postal Service. I defy anyone in this room to be able to name a single … All of us can name multiple times when we’ve sent a letter across town and it either didn’t get there or came back three months later undeliverable to a correct address.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-18-100th-anniversary-of-ratification-of-19th-amendment","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 18: 100th Anniversary of Ratification of 19th Amendment","13:08"
"Cleta Mitchell","So we know the president is not responsible for the problems at the post office, but there are things the Postal Service should do in conjunction with election officials, and they should do those now and make sure that the systems are in place to properly process the ballots that are sent by mail. But the problem is that we are facing hundreds of lawsuits that have been filed by the Democrats and leftist organizations to force states to not have polling places. I personally believe that we should have Election Day, we shouldn’t have election three months, and for sure, we ought to be able to know by election night who won. So Mr. President, you’re 100% right, and there are a lot of us who are standing behind you and want to help.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-18-100th-anniversary-of-ratification-of-19th-amendment","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 18: 100th Anniversary of Ratification of 19th Amendment","13:53"

"Heather Higgins","Can I add to the question before about women?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-18-100th-anniversary-of-ratification-of-19th-amendment","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 18: 100th Anniversary of Ratification of 19th Amendment","14:46"

"Heather Higgins","There are a lot of issues where what the president is doing, talking about public safety, which is increasingly a concern for women as they see what is going on, but also policies that he’s taken. So the president has done extraordinary things on healthcare. His executive order requiring price transparency, that is an issue that is 88% popular across the country, across party affiliations, across ideologies, across demographics. Among women who are 40 and under, it’s a 98% approval issue. Without this president being reelected, that executive order goes away because Congress hasn’t yet made it into a law, because it goes into effect in January of 2021.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-18-100th-anniversary-of-ratification-of-19th-amendment","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 18: 100th Anniversary of Ratification of 19th Amendment","14:50"
"Heather Higgins","So this has historically been the number one, if not top three issues in the country, and this is the only person who’s going to bring price transparency, which can bring down healthcare costs by 40%, revealing what the true prices are of your hospital or your insurance before you have to pay for it, so you can shop or other people will shop, and that will drive down prices. Enormous issue for this cohort. So women care about a lot of things.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-18-100th-anniversary-of-ratification-of-19th-amendment","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 18: 100th Anniversary of Ratification of 19th Amendment","15:33"
"Donald Trump","It’s so nice that you say that because they don’t speak about it, but transparency is a very controversial issue because doctors don’t like it, and frankly, hospitals don’t. The good doctors love it and the good hospitals love it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-18-100th-anniversary-of-ratification-of-19th-amendment","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 18: 100th Anniversary of Ratification of 19th Amendment","15:59"
"Heather Higgins","Doctors and patients love it. Hospitals, insurers, PBMs, which are the wholesalers that control the pharmacies, and pharma, they all have lobbyists all over Washington trying to stop what the president is doing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-18-100th-anniversary-of-ratification-of-19th-amendment","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 18: 100th Anniversary of Ratification of 19th Amendment","16:12"
"Donald Trump","I’ve had many people that are really expert at it. They say it’s a bigger issue than healthcare itself. It’ll save so much money and it’s the full deal. I signed it. It’s done. It goes into effect on January 1st. And you’re right. If the Democrats get in, they’ll probably try and end it, and what a shame that would be because it was so hard to get it done and it will save people massive amounts of money. I’m not talking about 1% or 2%.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-18-100th-anniversary-of-ratification-of-19th-amendment","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 18: 100th Anniversary of Ratification of 19th Amendment","16:23"
"Donald Trump","The other thing we just did, you probably heard, is I signed a favored nations clause on drugs because we have countries in the world, Germany and others, but we have many countries in the world that pay a tiny fraction. I don’t mean like 2%, less. 10% versus what we pay. You have a pill that will sell for 25 cents in a certain country in Europe that will sell for two and a half dollars in this country, and it’s so unfair to our people. And I signed a favored nations clause and the drug companies are spending millions and millions of dollars trying to get me not elected. And all it means when you see ads from drug companies, all it means is one thing. The drug prices are going to be coming down 50, 60, 70%, and they never thought anybody would do that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-18-100th-anniversary-of-ratification-of-19th-amendment","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 18: 100th Anniversary of Ratification of 19th Amendment","16:49"
"Donald Trump","I also signed a rebate clause. So the rebate money, instead of going to the middlemen, who are among the richest men of this country, and men and women, I guess, in this country by far. The middleman makes more money than the people that produce. At least the drug companies produce something. But I signed where the rebate goes to the people. There’s never been anything like this. And as a non-politician, I could do it. And I will tell you, I was called by a lot of politicians, that I was surprised at, literally begging me not to do it. “Please don’t do it. Please don’t do it.” And because the big pharma is by far the number one lobbyist paying group in the country, and people are loyal to big pharma and I’m all for big pharma, but this will be a tremendous drop.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-18-100th-anniversary-of-ratification-of-19th-amendment","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 18: 100th Anniversary of Ratification of 19th Amendment","17:32"
"Donald Trump","So between transparency and what I just did with respect to favored nations, that means if Germany pays 25 cents and we’re paying $2.50, we go down to 25 cents. That’s a number that nobody’s even thought of. And what will happen is they’ll have to pay more and we’re going to have to pay much, much less. And it could be 70, 80%, so we’re not talking about games. And nobody had the courage to sign it. A lot of people didn’t even know about it. A lot of people. So I appreciate very much. And it may be that transparency is even more important than that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-18-100th-anniversary-of-ratification-of-19th-amendment","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 18: 100th Anniversary of Ratification of 19th Amendment","18:22"
"Heather Higgins","I think it is, because transparency is the basis for markets and that’s the basis also for trust. Right now, you don’t have the right to know what something costs before you buy it. If airlines followed the same model as hospitals and insurers do, you wouldn’t know the price of your airline ticket until after you landed because they don’t know how full the flight is going to be. They don’t know how much fuel they’re going to have to spend. But every other business manages to do their average pricing. Hospitals know their average prices. That’s how they sell so quickly when somebody’s buying a hospital. They’re just not sharing it after the fact.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-18-100th-anniversary-of-ratification-of-19th-amendment","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 18: 100th Anniversary of Ratification of 19th Amendment","18:59"

"Donald Trump","No, but did I tell you? No, I think it’s great that we’re talking about something that you know a lot about and it does really pretend to exactly what you’re doing. I think it’s true. We did one other thing that is so important. Pharmacies, they didn’t have to give any information. You go in for a pill and the pharmacy gives you this crazy price, and you can’t price it, you can’t go around, you can’t do anything. I ended that practice. I said, “What do you mean? You can’t negotiate?” You didn’t even have the right to negotiate. I ended that and was met with a hailstorm. Everything I do, I get met with a hailstorm.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-18-100th-anniversary-of-ratification-of-19th-amendment","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 18: 100th Anniversary of Ratification of 19th Amendment","19:44"
"Donald Trump","But you know what? I do the right thing. I do the right thing for the people. I don’t need big pharma. They don’t help me. They help a lot of other people, but they don’t help me. I’m doing the right thing for the country. And let’s see whether or not people realize that they’re spending millions and millions of dollars on negative ads on me, and you see it’s big pharma. Unlimited money. They have so much money. They have unlimited money. And let’s see.

If you gave a real review, it wouldn’t be so fawning. I thought it was a very divisive speech, extremely divisive. We have a tremendous amount of enthusiasm for my campaign because of things like we’re talking about now, drug prices and drug cuts and a transparency with hospitals and doctors that are going to lower bills by 50%, 70%.

In fact, we did a study and the one for $32 actually did a better job. Okay. How about that? $2,532, and the cheap one did a better job using the exact same stuff. So that’s what we’re talking about.

The reviews they got for the handling of swine flu or H1N1, which Biden calls N1H1, and I don’t even correct him on that. I don’t even correct him. I said, “That’s a mistake you can make.” But that’s what he calls it. He’s got it a little mixed up, but that’s all right. Take a look at the Gallup poll, and there are others too.

"Press","The question is, when you speak to the suburban housewives of America, what do you view as the suburban woman voter? Is the suburban woman voter a suburban housewife or is there more in your assessment?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-18-100th-anniversary-of-ratification-of-19th-amendment","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 18: 100th Anniversary of Ratification of 19th Amendment","25:07"
"Donald Trump","That’s a very fair question. A great question, actually. Look, I view it very strongly that the suburban voter, the suburban housewife, women and men living in the suburbs, they want security and they want safety. They don’t want to have a lifetime of working hard and buying a house. And by the way, 30% of the people living in suburbia are minority groups. African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, they’re minority groups. They don’t want to have their American dream fulfilled and then have a low income housing project built right next to their house or in the neighborhood. They don’t want it. That’s not part of the deal. And I terminated that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-18-100th-anniversary-of-ratification-of-19th-amendment","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 18: 100th Anniversary of Ratification of 19th Amendment","25:21"
"Donald Trump","And I think that the suburban housewife, as you say, and I think that women and men living in the suburbs who fulfilled their American dream, or at least got a big part of it, they now live in a safe, beautiful area. They don’t want to have people coming in and forcing low income housing down their throats. And you know what? People can say I’m a bad person for doing that or they can say I’m a good person, but I think that suburban women very much appreciate what I did. I terminated it. This has been a hot issue for before President Obama, but he took it to a new level, and Biden is going to take it to yet another level.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-18-100th-anniversary-of-ratification-of-19th-amendment","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 18: 100th Anniversary of Ratification of 19th Amendment","26:08"
"Donald Trump","In fact, they say that Cory Booker, there’s another beauty, that Cory Booker is involved, and if Cory Booker’s involved, nothing good is going to happen. It’s very unfair to suburbia. Men, women, husbands, housewives, whatever you want to say, it’s very unfair. And I think it’s a very important issue and I think they respect very much what I did and nobody else would have had the guts to do it. Thank you all very much. We’ll be signing for Susan B, Anthony the full pardon very, very soon.
