"Dr. Sean Conley","Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for being here.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trumps-medical-team-press-conference-transcript-from-walter-reed-on-trumps-condition-october-5","Donald Trump’s Medical Team Press Conference Transcript from Walter Reed on Trump’s Condition October 5","00:15"
"Dr. Sean Conley","Over the past 24 hours, the president has continued to improve. He’s met or exceeded all standard hospital discharge criteria. He’ll receive another dose of remdesivir here today, and then we plan to get him home. It’s been more than 72 hours since his last fever, oxygen levels, including ambulatory saturations and his work of breathing are all normal. Though he may not entirely be out of the woods yet, the team and I agree that all our evaluations, and most importantly his clinical status, support the president’s safe return home, where he’ll be surrounded by world-class medical care 24/7.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trumps-medical-team-press-conference-transcript-from-walter-reed-on-trumps-condition-october-5","Donald Trump’s Medical Team Press Conference Transcript from Walter Reed on Trump’s Condition October 5","00:19"
"Dr. Sean Conley","I’d like to bring Dr. Dooley up to review some more specifics.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trumps-medical-team-press-conference-transcript-from-walter-reed-on-trumps-condition-october-5","Donald Trump’s Medical Team Press Conference Transcript from Walter Reed on Trump’s Condition October 5","00:58"
"Dr. Sean Dooley","Good afternoon, just a brief update this morning. As Dr. Conley mentioned, the president continues to do very well. His vital signs this morning were notable for a temperature of 98.1, his blood pressure was 134 over 78, and a respiratory rate of 17 respirations per minute, and his heart rate was 68 beats per minute. His last oxyhemoglobin saturation was 97% on room air. He currently does not endorse any respiratory complaints, and aside from our evaluation with the multi-disciplinary team this morning, has maintained a full schedule, ambulating and working on the White House medical unit.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trumps-medical-team-press-conference-transcript-from-walter-reed-on-trumps-condition-october-5","Donald Trump’s Medical Team Press Conference Transcript from Walter Reed on Trump’s Condition October 5","01:06"
"Dr. Sean Dooley","I’ll now turn it over to Dr. Garibaldi to again discuss therapeutics.

"Dr. Brian Garibaldi","Hi, good afternoon. Again, I just wanted to echo the sentiment of what an honor it is to be part of this wonderful team here at Walter Reed. Yesterday evening the president received his third dose of remdesivir and he tolerated that infusion without difficulty and his kidney and liver function continued to be normal. Our plan is to give the fourth dose of remdesivir this evening before he goes back to the White House. We’ve made arrangements to deliver the fifth and final dose of his treatment course at the White House tomorrow evening. He continues on dexamethasone and, again, the plan for today is to continue to be up and out of bed, eat and drink, and work as he is able.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trumps-medical-team-press-conference-transcript-from-walter-reed-on-trumps-condition-october-5","Donald Trump’s Medical Team Press Conference Transcript from Walter Reed on Trump’s Condition October 5","01:52"
"Dr. Brian Garibaldi","I’d like to turn it over to Dr. Jason Blaylock, who’s an infectious disease specialist and the chief of medicine here at Walter Reed to give some updates on infection control. Thank you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trumps-medical-team-press-conference-transcript-from-walter-reed-on-trumps-condition-october-5","Donald Trump’s Medical Team Press Conference Transcript from Walter Reed on Trump’s Condition October 5","02:25"
"Dr. Jason Blaylock","Good afternoon, everyone. First of all, I just want to say what an honor it’s been to be part of this medical team behind me and to care for the president.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trumps-medical-team-press-conference-transcript-from-walter-reed-on-trumps-condition-october-5","Donald Trump’s Medical Team Press Conference Transcript from Walter Reed on Trump’s Condition October 5","02:37"
"Dr. Jason Blaylock","Since the president’s arrival at Walter Reed, he’s received medical management that remains in line with national, clinical, societal guidelines for treatment of COVID-19 infection. In addition, both myself and Dr. Wes Campbell have worked very closely with various laboratories in the area, state-of-the-art facilities, to include USAMRAA and [RAR 00:03:10] on obtaining advanced diagnostic testing to really inform the White House medical team of both the status of the president, as well as his ability to transmit virus to others. Also, we have worked very closely with the Walter Reed team to ensure that we are looking very closely at infection control prevention strategies and the right posture so that the president can safely return to his residence.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trumps-medical-team-press-conference-transcript-from-walter-reed-on-trumps-condition-october-5","Donald Trump’s Medical Team Press Conference Transcript from Walter Reed on Trump’s Condition October 5","02:46"
"Dr. Jason Blaylock","With that, I’m going to turn it over to Dr. Conley, who will answer any final questions?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trumps-medical-team-press-conference-transcript-from-walter-reed-on-trumps-condition-october-5","Donald Trump’s Medical Team Press Conference Transcript from Walter Reed on Trump’s Condition October 5","03:38"

"Dr. Sean Conley","I mentioned it Saturday, but I’d like to reiterate myself just how grateful the president and I are to the men and women of Walter Reed, our colleagues at Johns Hopkins, as well as the many federal, private institutions that we’ve received support from. So long as everything continues on the track that we’re experiencing right now, at this time, as the president already tweeted out, is to get him home later today. With that, I’ll take a couple questions.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trumps-medical-team-press-conference-transcript-from-walter-reed-on-trumps-condition-october-5","Donald Trump’s Medical Team Press Conference Transcript from Walter Reed on Trump’s Condition October 5","03:46"
"Speaker 5","Dr. Conley, how can the president be discharged back to the White House when he was given steroids. You’ve said that he’s still on those steroids. Those are medicines, as you know, that are usually given to COVID patients who are on ventilators or with low oxygen, so did you over-treat him? If he’s still on that medication, how is it safe for him to return to the White House?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trumps-medical-team-press-conference-transcript-from-walter-reed-on-trumps-condition-october-5","Donald Trump’s Medical Team Press Conference Transcript from Walter Reed on Trump’s Condition October 5","04:12"
"Dr. Sean Conley","We send patients home with medications all the time. In fact, yesterday afternoon, he probably met most of his discharge requirements safely from the hospital. He’s returning to a facility, the White House medical unit, that’s staffed 24/7, top-notch physicians, nurses, PAs, logisticians. The unit here, the team here behind me, is going to continue to support us in that nature.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trumps-medical-team-press-conference-transcript-from-walter-reed-on-trumps-condition-october-5","Donald Trump’s Medical Team Press Conference Transcript from Walter Reed on Trump’s Condition October 5","04:30"

"Speaker 6","Dr. Conley. Dr. Conley, what are infection control measures are you taking and how was it safe for him to drive around in a cloth mask yesterday? How is it safe for him now to return to the White House where there’ve been so many cases? How’s any of this safe?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trumps-medical-team-press-conference-transcript-from-walter-reed-on-trumps-condition-october-5","Donald Trump’s Medical Team Press Conference Transcript from Walter Reed on Trump’s Condition October 5","04:57"
"Dr. Sean Conley","The president has been surrounded by medical and security staff for days wearing full PPE. Yesterday, the US Secret Service agents were in that same level of PPE for a very short period of time. We’ve worked with our infectious disease experts to make some recommendations for how to keep everything safe down at the White House for the president and those around him. We’re looking at where he’s going to be able to carry out his duties, office space. I’ll just say that it’s in line with everything we’ve been doing upstairs for the last several days.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trumps-medical-team-press-conference-transcript-from-walter-reed-on-trumps-condition-october-5","Donald Trump’s Medical Team Press Conference Transcript from Walter Reed on Trump’s Condition October 5","05:12"

Do you remember when he had his last negative test?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trumps-medical-team-press-conference-transcript-from-walter-reed-on-trumps-condition-october-5","Donald Trump’s Medical Team Press Conference Transcript from Walter Reed on Trump’s Condition October 5","06:00"

"Speaker 7","It helps for contact tracing for people who were around him to know when he was positive.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trumps-medical-team-press-conference-transcript-from-walter-reed-on-trumps-condition-october-5","Donald Trump’s Medical Team Press Conference Transcript from Walter Reed on Trump’s Condition October 5","06:10"
"Dr. Sean Conley","I understand. The contact tracing, as I understand it, is being done. I’m not involved in that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trumps-medical-team-press-conference-transcript-from-walter-reed-on-trumps-condition-october-5","Donald Trump’s Medical Team Press Conference Transcript from Walter Reed on Trump’s Condition October 5","06:13"

"Dr. Sean Conley","No. We try to get patients home and out of the hospital as quickly as is safe and reasonable. Every day a patient stays in the hospital unnecessarily is a risk to themselves. Right now there’s nothing that’s being done upstairs here that we can’t safely conduct down home.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trumps-medical-team-press-conference-transcript-from-walter-reed-on-trumps-condition-october-5","Donald Trump’s Medical Team Press Conference Transcript from Walter Reed on Trump’s Condition October 5","06:23"
"Speaker 9","You had said that seven to ten days was a window that you’d be concerned about. I don’t think we’re there yet. Do you have concerns about potential worsening or reversal? What are your plans for addressing that if it were to happen?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trumps-medical-team-press-conference-transcript-from-walter-reed-on-trumps-condition-october-5","Donald Trump’s Medical Team Press Conference Transcript from Walter Reed on Trump’s Condition October 5","06:42"
"Dr. Sean Conley","You’re absolutely right. That’s why we all remain cautiously optimistic and on guard because we’re in a bit of unchartered territory when it comes to a patient that received the therapies he has so early in the course. We’re looking to this weekend. If we can get through to Monday with him remaining the same or improving, better yet, then we will all take that final deep sigh of relief. But as I said, 24/7 world-class medical care surrounding him down there. We’re not going to miss anything that we would have caught up here.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trumps-medical-team-press-conference-transcript-from-walter-reed-on-trumps-condition-october-5","Donald Trump’s Medical Team Press Conference Transcript from Walter Reed on Trump’s Condition October 5","06:55"

"Dr. Sean Conley","Yesterday, we talked about that, the several little temporary drops in his oxygen, and we had discussed that as a team and elected to start it early in case that persisted or worsened. The potential risks and side effects, we all discussed. We looked at the data and decided that we’d rather, push ahead on it then hold and risk the opposite.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trumps-medical-team-press-conference-transcript-from-walter-reed-on-trumps-condition-october-5","Donald Trump’s Medical Team Press Conference Transcript from Walter Reed on Trump’s Condition October 5","07:46"

There’s a reason there’s the 10 days. It’s because most people, by that time, after seven days, most folks don’t have culturable live virus. They put it to 10, just to give some extra space. It’s never 100% between everybody, so we’ll see. I’m not going to put a specific number, but we look at that window is all I will say.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trumps-medical-team-press-conference-transcript-from-walter-reed-on-trumps-condition-october-5","Donald Trump’s Medical Team Press Conference Transcript from Walter Reed on Trump’s Condition October 5","13:15"

"Speaker 23","You said, I’m going to read this here, that the president had a mild cough, some nasal congestion and fatigue on Thursday.
