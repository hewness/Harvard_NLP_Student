"President Donald Trump","Pat, I’ve been a fan of yours for a long time. I’ve known you for a long time. You do one hell of a job, and you’re pretty popular with these people I see. [crosstalk 00:00:28]. Thank you, Pat. Well, maybe I’ll say a few words. It’s appropriate in light of everything that’s going on. When you look at all of the statistics, all of the numbers, New York’s finest, I love, and you’re the finest, they just don’t let you do the job [crosstalk 00:00:44].

"President Donald Trump","So it’s my great honor to proudly accept something that Pat’s going to give me in a little while, so I’ll hold off on the word endorsement, but he’s going to give me an endorsement, I understand. And I have deeply and profoundly admired the brave men and women, as you know, of New York City’s finest, and I’ve admired you my whole life. My whole life I’ve watched you do a job like nobody else. Nobody else has done it. And truly, you’re the best of the best and I’m grateful. And I’m very happy that you’re here, and we’ll have a little fun for a little while, but first we’re going to talk a little business. We have to talk business because we have to straighten out our city. Our city’s a mess.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-14-cops-for-trump-new-york","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 14: Cops for Trump New York","00:49"
"President Donald Trump","Every day, the courageous offices of NYPD put your lives on the line to protect the innocent and to put violent criminals behind bars. You protect people you’ve never met before. You know, I’ve heard that expression a long time ago, and it always means something to me. You’re protecting people with your lives, people that you’ve never met before, and you’ve done an incredible job.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-14-cops-for-trump-new-york","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 14: Cops for Trump New York","01:33"
"President Donald Trump","And the world will never forget the New York police offices who ran into the smoke and flames of 9/11, I was there, many never to return. We salute the heroes of NYPD and we salute our law enforcement heroes all across the nation. I was responsible, along with a couple of people that were right in this audience, for getting you some very good and large payments so that we can take care of some of the people that were hurt so badly. Longterm hurt they call it, right? Longterm hurt, but we got it done and we got it signed.

"President Donald Trump","As we gather today, our country is suffering from a radical far left movement. It’s not even to be believed when you see this, what they’re thinking. Where did these people come from? Where do they come from? That is trying to defame, demoralize, defund, dismantle, and dissolve our great police departments. It’s a left wing war on cops.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-14-cops-for-trump-new-york","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 14: Cops for Trump New York","02:44"

And probably, she’s a step worse. She’s a step worse, Kamala. I was sort of hoping he was going to pick Pocahontas, but that [ inaudible 00:03:32]. She of Indian heritage number. Remember I said I have more Indian than her, I have more Indian than she does? And I went into it. I went into it at great length and I turned out to be right.

"President Donald Trump","Portland and Chicago are the left’s roadmap to America, and sadly, what’s happened over the last year in New York City. And it’s an incredible thing to look at, an incredible, incredible thing. And I just saw somebody here named Rudy Giuliani. Do you know Rudy Giuliani? Where’s Rudy? Is he around here? Get up here, Rudy. Get up. What are you doing down there, Mr. Mayor? This the greatest Mayor our city has ever had. Rudy, come on up here. Come on up. What a great… And he’s a man who is loyal and dedicated and tough. He got on television to defend me. He said things that even I wouldn’t say. He was brutal. He is incredible. He knew.

"President Donald Trump","Joe Biden’s national police strategy will be modeled on the Bill DeBlasio, catastrophe. It’s a catastrophe. No one will be safe in Biden’s American, no city, no town, no suburb will be spared. And you see how I did something to help the suburbs of our country last week? A lot of people don’t want to even talk about it, but we did something that nobody else would have done. They’re ruining your suburbs. They want to ruin it. They want to destroy their housing values and your safety. But we ended it. We ended the program entirely. Somebody said, “Let’s amend it.” I said, “No, let’s end it.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-14-cops-for-trump-new-york","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 14: Cops for Trump New York","04:40"
"President Donald Trump","The Biden-Harris agenda, and I guess Harris could be bigger than you think in terms of the importances of vice president. They said there’s never been a more important pick, but in the end it’s not going to matter because we’re going to win. [crosstalk 00:05:34]. You know, honestly, we don’t have a choice. We have to win. This country will go to hell. The stock markets will crash. Your 401ks are going to be worthless. You’ll see.

"President Donald Trump","I mean, you take a look at Portland. You take a look at Chicago, and I can name plenty of other cities, but I don’t want to embarrass anybody.

"President Donald Trump","So in recent months, New York City has witnessed the horrors that result from putting extreme left politicians into power. DeBlasio has launched a crusade against, and he really has, he has launched a real crusade against the police like I don’t think anybody’s ever really seen, but there are cases that are just as bad. There are some cases, radical left, that may be even are worse.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-14-cops-for-trump-new-york","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 14: Cops for Trump New York","06:03"
"President Donald Trump","The mobs have scrawled disgusting slogans such as cops must die. Think of this, cops must die and kill all cops. Okay? Who would even have thought 10 years ago that was possible? On the side of buildings, they put those terms. And they vandalized St. Patrick’s Cathedral, the beautiful St. Patrick’s Cathedral, with horrible, horrible statements, horrible phrases. And then of course that disgusting chant, “Pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon,” right?

"President Donald Trump","And now, all of a sudden, it becomes mainstream. It becomes, “Oh, isn’t this wonderful?” They were talking about you. You know that, right? We just can’t forget it because we have to bring law and order back to our cities, back to our country, and we’re doing it. Wherever we go, we do it.

"President Donald Trump","Rioters have rampaged through Manhattan and looted Fifth Avenue and an NYPD Sargent was left, as you know very well, in critical condition after being rundown with a car. A Molotov cocktail was thrown into a police vehicle in Brooklyn. And NYPD’s highest ranking uniform chief and other offices were beaten in broad daylight on the Brooklyn Bridge. And they’re not allowed to fight back. You’re not allowed to fight back. You fight back, you lose your pension, you lose your life. They put you in jail you fight back. No, you got to be able to fight back.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-14-cops-for-trump-new-york","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 14: Cops for Trump New York","07:30"
"President Donald Trump","I mean, to me, one of the saddest, and I don’t want to embarrass anybody, but one of the saddest things, Rudy, that I’ve ever seen, Pat, was when they were dumping water on the heads of two of your fellow officers. And I wish they fought back. I promise nothing would have happened to them. Because who even knew that was water? It could have been plenty of other things. It probably was actually. But it could have been some very dangerous material, not water. And they didn’t fight back. The first time I’ve ever seen that. I wish they did. I wish they did. I wish I could have talked to them.

You know, the Democrats have an advantage because they have certain people that automatically vote. And we’re going from New York. We’re going for New York [crosstalk 00:09:02]. Because we did well last time. You know, New York is not supposed to be Republican territory. It was Ronald Reagan. But a lot of the people left. A lot of the people that voted for Ronald Reagan left. That was the last time. And they voted for Ronald Reagan, but they left. They went on to other places.

"President Donald Trump","Their pro-crime agenda, the Biden-Harris group will also crush our economy because there is no prosperity in cities that are ruled by fear. And I even think the politicians are afraid. If you look at Portland, the Mayor is trying to say, “Oh, these are my friends.” And then he goes in there, they want to beat the hell out of him. And then the fake news doesn’t report that. They’ll show him standing there with the sound down so you don’t hear what they’re saying to the Mayor. Fortunately, he had five body guards when he went in, right? But it was very dangerous for him. And I don’t know if he’s doing this at a stupidity or out of fear.

Even the New York Times said it was incredible deal. Can you believe? The New York Times? I can’t even believe it. Thomas Friedman, they wrote an incredible editorial. It was a great deal. So we did this deal. Nobody else did it. In fact, we were at a huge deficit because of the horrible deal that Obama made with Iran. Gave them $150 billion, billion, not million. 150 million’s a lot. That would be too much also. 150 billion then gave them 1.8 billion in cash. I broke the deal. I terminated the deal, but we made a deal, UAE and Israel.

And now we’re building it back up very rapidly. You see the numbers. But they were taking credit. They said, “Oh, this was Obama. Obama.” He said manufacturing would never come back. That was Obama. Manufacturing has come back big. In fact, even two days ago, they announced incredible numbers. When asked recently if he favors cutting police budget, Biden replied. “Yes, absolutely.” But I’m not sure honestly he knew what he was replying to so we’re not … “Yes, absolutely. What did I say? What was I referring to?” You could use that clip for a million different things right? Yes, absolutely. You never say that as a politician.

After the riots in Minneapolis, Kamala encouraged Americans to donate money to the so-called Minnesota Freedom Fund, which bailed out rapists, assaulters and murderers.

I said, “We’re talking about the president of the United States.” I can tell you one thing. Putin and Kim Jong Un and President Xi of China, they’re not sleepy. We’re never going to say sleepy or slow, and we can’t have slow, sleepy people dealing with them either because we were doing very well against all of them. All of them. And we’re have a good relationship now. Remember North Korea? We were going to go to war with North Korea. Obama would have been in a war. Millions of people could have been killed in that war. Where’s the war? Everybody said, “Trump will be in war in the first week.” Where’s the war? In fact, we’re bringing people out of the endless Wars. The Wars that where their doing your job. They’re policemen and that’s great, but they want to fight. They want to win. We didn’t let people win. Bring them back. We shouldn’t have been there in the first place. So we bring them back, and what we’re doing is bringing them back with great dignity.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-14-cops-for-trump-new-york","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 14: Cops for Trump New York","17:37"
"President Donald Trump","It’s incredible what’s happened. We’ve totally rebuilt our armed forces, $2.5 trillion. We’ve given you hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment. Pat, you know that. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment came out of … It was collecting dust, right? It was army surplus stuff and all the different … It was beautiful stuff and Obama didn’t want you to have it. They said it made you look too strong, too tough. You look too military. So they said, “Let them get shot.” Much of it was protective equipment. You know that. I released it all. I gave it to all the police departments all across the country and I have had more thank yous for that. And someday, they’re going to have to explain why they didn’t want to do it. And this was sitting there. It was not going to be used. A lot of it was new, but it wasn’t going to be used. And I said, “Give it to our great police all over the country.” And we did and it’s been great.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-14-cops-for-trump-new-york","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 14: Cops for Trump New York","18:41"
"President Donald Trump","And just to finish up, I call it the manifesto because Bernie Sanders, he was going to make an agreement and they were going to go a little bit further right. They didn’t. They went further left than Bernie was. So in the manifesto, Biden pledges to abolish cash bail. How about that? No cash bail. No bail, meaning that violent and dangerous criminals would simply be released after arrest. New York tried this insane policy and crime surged nearly 25% in New York City and now it’s up much, much higher than that. This is an old statistic. It’s up much higher than that. So nationwide, the Biden plan to abolish bail would release over 400,000 criminals on our streets.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-14-cops-for-trump-new-york","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 14: Cops for Trump New York","19:34"
"President Donald Trump","So all I’m saying is this. We have the greatest police departments. We have great police. We have great forces. They have to be allowed to do their job. And I’ve seen Pat and I’ve seen you. You’re going to have a bad apple. You’re going to have somebody who makes a horrible mistake. You’re going to have somebody has a bad moment, but it may be just a bad apple. We’ve seen it. But that doesn’t mean we’re going to close up our police departments. And like in Minneapolis, tell them to run. Leave, leave. Did you ever see anything like that? Where they left? Where they left? We can’t ever let that happen. We sent in the National Guard five or six days later. We waited, we waited, we waited. Within one hour, the whole thing was … You never heard of anything. On these monuments and statues, you saw that? They were trying to rip them down. They ripped some down. I immediately signed an order that if you get caught ripping down a monument or a statue, you get 10 years in jail. 10 years.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-14-cops-for-trump-new-york","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 14: Cops for Trump New York","20:23"
"President Donald Trump","And I don’t know about you, I haven’t seen too many statues being ripped down lately. They were going to have a march on Washington, Washington. They wanted to rip down statues. I said, “So wait a minute. You’re going to rip down statues, you’re going to go to jail for 10 years.” I signed it publicly. Very public. You got to let them know or otherwise, it’s not fair. They get 10 years, they didn’t know about it right? Wise guys. So we let them know you get 10 years in jail. I took an old law because they don’t do those laws today. Today, get that through the house. Tell Nancy Pelosi we’re going to give somebody 10 years. She’s terrible. Look at what’s happened to San Francisco. Look at the tents. Look at the homeless. That’s Nancy. She ought to go home and clean up her own city, but take a look.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-14-cops-for-trump-new-york","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 14: Cops for Trump New York","21:26"
"President Donald Trump","But it’s 10 years in jail. They were going to have a big march on Washington. They were going to come down and knock down. They had them earmarked. And as soon as they announced that, nobody showed up. It was amazing. Big march, nobody showed up. They said, “No, we’re going to do it the following …” That was a Thursday night. “We’re going to do it the next night, Friday.” Nobody showed up except four people. They all got arrested because they were the four people that the media had on top of the statue of Andrew Jackson doing damage. Almost got it down. And I’ll say something. The Washington, the D.C. police were great because they had the ropes. You saw the ropes. They were ready to pull it down. They were all set and our guys said, “Stop it.” And those guys ran in and that thing was over. Those Washington, those D.C. police did a job. That wasn’t like you know. They did a job. So we’re going to give you back your stature. We’re going to give you back your status. I hate to say it, but it’s been taken away. We’re going to give you back the right to be New York’s finest, the finest of all time, the greatest of all time, and we’re going to win on November 3rd. And the people that didn’t love Trump, never Trumpers, a lot of them are saying, “I’m starting to like Trump a lot,” because they see what’s happening. And we’re going to give New York a real shot and I think we have one hell of a shot at doing it. I just said this morning, the New York Post, which has been great. The New York post had a cover story about that. They came and interviewed me at the Oval Office and they talked about law and order in the city. And I said, “I did very well, Republican wise. I did very well.” We did great, and I really believe that that solid core of people has to be real. First of all, they’re leaving. A lot of them are leaving, but they have to be discuss-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-14-cops-for-trump-new-york","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 14: Cops for Trump New York","22:14"
"President Donald Trump","I mean first of all they are leaving a lot of them are leaving, but they have to be disgusted with what’s going on. So I said then and there and I said it today. I put it out today strongly, we’re going to go and give New York a real shot. I think we have a real chance of winning New York, but we’re going to give you so much of what you’re looking for. Because I know exactly it’s so easy you need leadership, you need money, you can’t defund. It has to go the other way. You need equipment.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-14-cops-for-trump-new-york","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 14: Cops for Trump New York","24:03"
"President Donald Trump","But what do you need more than anything else is your dignity and respect. You need respect, you need your dignity back and this guy has taken your dignity away and your respect away. And I am telling you on November 3rd you’re going to be getting it back like you haven’t gotten it back before. Because this is really a referendum. So I want to thank you very much.

"Speaker 7","USA, USA, USA. Mr. President, today it’s an honor for me to stand at this podium and be the voice for 24,000 New York city police officers, proud police officers that are here today chanting USA, chanting Trump for president and they mean it each and every time they say it. Mr. President, it’s obvious where you hold the NYPD in your heart. We heard the news this morning that you got some family news that your brother had fallen ill. And naturally we thought well, we may have to postpone this. The president may not be able to come. And then our phones rang and we were told that the president will visit his brother and then he will visit with you. That’s where he puts you. New York city police officers and family. That’s the type of president we have.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-14-cops-for-trump-new-york","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 14: Cops for Trump New York","24:59"
"Speaker 7","Mr. President what we all have in common here today is that we all have a police officers shield in our hip pocket. We all have friends and family that are here to support you. And more importantly, in this crowd is our family members too. The ones that worry what happens when their loved one takes that last step off the stoop and goes to work and they know they may not come back. And we know you understand that Mr. President, because you’re constantly always loud about the support for New York city police officers. Mr. President, this city you helped build, the borough where your father started in South Jamaica is sliding back. The borough in which you build so many skyscrapers was just recently looted. Our city is sliding back because the mantra, the false narrative that not only city hall, the second floor in the state house and those that want to become president are passing this false narrative that New York city police officers and law enforcement are evil.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-14-cops-for-trump-new-york","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 14: Cops for Trump New York","26:16"
"Speaker 7","How absurd is that? That they blame us for society’s ills? Well, let me tell you this Mr. President I know you know that. The most compassionate people on the face of the earth are New York city police officers. Mr. President, if you look at the crime numbers in New York city we’re sliding back where we’re at shootings. We’re at shooting levels back to 1993. That’s because of that narrative against the police officers, that’s where they’re handcuffing our members. That’s where they’re saying if you take a bad guy off the street that you will go to jail. Now that’s the upside down world. So what we can’t do is let that attitude spread beyond the city, beyond the state house and go to the white house Mr. President.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-14-cops-for-trump-new-york","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 14: Cops for Trump New York","27:34"
"Speaker 7","So we here today for a reason, a reason that you understand to support not only New York city police officers, but law enforcement across this country. And this is not new for you Mr. President, you do it always. See, the sign of a leader is someone that will stand at a podium like this and speak the truth and will say what needs to be said and not be afraid to do it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-14-cops-for-trump-new-york","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 14: Cops for Trump New York","28:35"
"Speaker 7","Well, we are seeing leaders in our state that are following the crowd Mr. Mayor. Mr. President what they’re doing is not only following marches, they’re following riders. They’re trying to catch up and do whatever they can to make sure they’re happy. I often times wake up and say who were they listening to? They’re not listening to the folks in the neighborhoods that we patrol. They’re not listening to the folks that say we want police on our streets and we want to respect them. So today Mr. President, there’s two things that we’d like to do. We’d like to present you with a statue that means so much to New York city officers. This statue, we do not hand out lightly. This statue is very special to New York city police officers for what it represents. This is a police officer standing tall and proud with his hand on the shoulder of a child. Now that child represents not only a little boy, not only a little girl, but a crime victim, someone that needs our help, someone that was victimized. That’s what police officers do every day in this country and this city and this state. They stop, they put their hands, they give their comforting words, the compassionate words that helps everyone. Mr. President we know that you hold police offices in high esteem. So there’s not many of these that are given out, but we’re giving it to you today Mr. President. We hope that you can put this in a prominent spot and that people that can see it and realize that those that are in the mob that are tearing down what we do, our profession has a supporter in the oval office that understands what this stands for. Mr. President it’s my honor.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-14-cops-for-trump-new-york","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 14: Cops for Trump New York","29:09"

"Speaker 7","Mr. President, I said we have two things to present to you and we presented a special statue. But we also have some practical work to do because there’s election that we’re in the midst of. So I’m here to say this number one, I have 36 years on this job, 21 as the president of this fine organization. I cannot remember when we’ve ever endorsed for the office of president of the United States until now. That’s how important this is. Mr. President we’re fighting for our lives out there. We don’t want this to spread to the rest of the country. We need your strong voice across the country to say we have the support of law enforcement across this country. Now, many times people say that a union like ours, law enforcement groups give endorsements, not in the New York city PBA sir. In the New York city PBA Mr. President you earn the endorsement and you’ve earned this endorsement. I’m proud to give it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-14-cops-for-trump-new-york","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 14: Cops for Trump New York","31:47"

They have a lot of fake media, fake news, false news, call it whatever you want, corrupt news. But you have no idea how much the people of this country love our police departments, our police, our law enforcement, our border patrols, our ICE people. ICE they go into the toughest situations. They take out MS13 by the thousands and then they get abused. But they’re not really abused, they’re loved by the people of this country.

We have New York city’s greatest mayor of all time. He took over a city that I don’t know, was worse. Maybe better. I don’t know what I’m going to ask Rudy what’s the difference between that city and the city of today? Certainly it caught up very quickly for a long while it was a lot better, but when Rudy ran it, it was incredible. The crime statistics, the murder. I hate to use that word, murder. I don’t know if this place has ever heard that word murder.

Without New York’s finest he couldn’t have done it. He let them do the job and he had three very great commissioners. He keeps telling me three great commissioners. I always say, “Who is the best?” He doesn’t want to tell me maybe he’ll tell you. But I’ve asked him many times, “Who is the best Rudy I want to know who?

I grew up with you and then I got to work with you as a prosecutor, and I get credit for bringing down crime more than any other mayor ever. Anywhere, but you did it. I didn’t do it. I know you did it. That’s why every time you were hurt, every time you were injured, I’d be the first one to show up at the hospital.

We took over the Housing Police. We took over the Transit Police. We made them all one, because I needed to reassign them to the right places. We took police officers out of white neighborhoods that voted for me, who were really angry at me for doing it, and we put it into black neighborhoods where Al Sharpton would complain about us. But the people loved it and would ask me for more. People in Harlem asked me for more. Bedford-Stuyvesant and Fort Greene, all the places you know so well.

Can you believe that? We’re teaching that to our children. They’re being forced-fed that in school, and then they get it from the media. It has to be you, the best representatives of the constitution, the law, fairness, decency, protection of people, have always been police offices because you do something that all the people who criticize you don’t do.

Everybody wanted to rush on the plane and every other candidate I ever saw rushed on the plane. He never once rushed on the plane. No matter how far he had a walk, he went up to the uniform and he shook hands with every single one of them. He did it because it’s for real. He’s not a politician. He’s actually a real person. That’s why, he’s accomplished in three and a half years, more than any other president, I interviewed an African-American gentleman the other day. I have a tape.
