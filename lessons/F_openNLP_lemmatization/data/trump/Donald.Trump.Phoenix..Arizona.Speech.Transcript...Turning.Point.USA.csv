And we had a great evening and the ratings came out you saw that, on television. It was the number one show in Fox history for a Saturday night. Number one. Ratings. For them, it’s all about the ratings. I know that the other folks back there, CNN, and MSDNC I know they’re very happy. They’re very happy to see that Fox said the number one show. This is the number one show in the history of Fox News. That’s pretty good.

That’s what you are and really smart. And you’ll be up here someday. Somebody in that audience, maybe a few of you. You’re going to be up here. Right here. Who are tough and smart and determined and truly unstoppable. You are. I want to thank also Kimberly and I want to thank my son. Boy, I watched my son. I got here. Wow. I said, “What’s this all about?” He’s good. And the people like him. People like him a lot. To everyone here today and watching live all across our country, Thank you for bravely defending our nation, our values and our great American heroes. You know what’s going on, because you’re on the front lines of a tremendous intellectual struggle for the future of our country. That’s really what you’re talking about. The future of our country. You see what’s happening. It’s a disgrace. It’s a disgrace. If we weren’t here, you could forget it.

"Donald Trump","November 3rd is a big day. Get out, get the parents, get the friends, get the husband, get the wife, get everybody. Now, the difference is they get everybody. Even if they’re not registered, if they’re not citizens, if they’re here illegally, they get everybody. That’s one of the little difficulties. And , you go through a whole nation and you see what’s going on and they report zero illegality, check out California, sometime.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-phoenix-arizona-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa","Donald Trump Phoenix, Arizona Speech Transcript – Turning Point USA","04:46"
"Donald Trump","No, check out the deal that they signed with Judicial Watch. I think Judicial Watch was 1 million, or 1.5 million people they settled. They agreed that that many people either voted illegally, shouldn’t have been voting, a lot of things. They settled. And Judicial Watch said, “Look, we were so high. What difference did it make? What difference would it make?” No. But they play a very dirty game. You’re fighting against an oppressive left wing ideology that is driven by hate and seeks to purge all dissent. And you understand that. Amazing at that age. You’re young people, generally, a couple of oldsters out there, friends of mine.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-phoenix-arizona-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa","Donald Trump Phoenix, Arizona Speech Transcript – Turning Point USA","05:19"

But we have Charlie and we have our people and our people is stronger. Our people are stronger And our people are smarter and we are the elite. We are the elite. If you haven’t noticed, they said it two weeks ago. I was talking to somebody who says, “Well, you know, the elite.” I said, “What are you talking about the elite? Who’s the elite? They’re the elite?” They’re not the elite.

They are vicious. They are vicious people. Anyone who dissents from their orthodoxy must be punished, canceled, or banished. That includes from television. You see it. But you will not be silenced. And the bottom line, I get interviewed by people and I’m sitting there the other day in the Oval Office. And I didn’t like the tone. And I said, “It’s really nice because I’m here and you’re not.” The Oval Office.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-phoenix-arizona-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa","Donald Trump Phoenix, Arizona Speech Transcript – Turning Point USA","06:45"

Unbelievable spirit. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. But the radical left, they hate our history. They hate our values and they hate everything we prize as Americans, and we’re right, because our country didn’t grow great with them.

"Donald Trump","The left wing mob is trying to demolish our heritage so they can replace it with a new repressive regime that they alone control. They’re tearing down statues, desecrating monuments, and purging dissenters. It’s not the behavior of a peaceful political movement. It’s the behavior of totalitarians and tyrants and people that don’t love our country. They don’t love our country. The left is not trying to promote justice, or equality, or lift up the downtrodden. They have one goal, the pursuit of their own political power, for whatever reason, but that’s their goal. That really seems to be their goal. Their goal, or their sickness. And if you give power to people that demolish monuments and attack churches and seize city streets, and set fire to buildings, then nothing is sacred and no one is safe. We stopped them last night. Did you see that? Andrew Jackson. And brought some to jail and others are going to jail. The problem we have is states. They’re weak. Many of the governors, many of the mayors, you see what’s going on. And by the way, just so you understand, it’s all liberal Democrat states. Could you imagine if sleepy Joe ever became president, this country would be a mess. They would rip down everything, everything. Sleepy Joe. And he wouldn’t call the shots. He would have nothing to do with him. “Lock him in the Oval Office. Let’s just do what we want to do.” And today he’s with Obama, President Obama. It only took him, how long, a year and a half to endorse him? What did it take, a year and a half to endorse him? Even after he won, he didn’t endorse him for a long time.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-phoenix-arizona-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa","Donald Trump Phoenix, Arizona Speech Transcript – Turning Point USA","08:51"
"Donald Trump","Then he’s fighting. He’s fighting for sleepy Joe. He really feels strongly about it, so strongly that he was fighting. He wanted everybody to win, but Joe. Joe won. But if you remember in my campaign, he fought harder than crooked Hillary. President Obama fought me harder. He said, “You cannot let him win. You cannot this…” He was all over the place. I said, “This guy’s spending all of his time campaigning against me.” Who won? That’s right. And don’t forget. Don’t forget. I’m only here because of him and Biden. I’m only here because of them, because if they did a good job, we wouldn’t have been here. There would have been no reason. I’m only here because of President Obama and the job he did and sleepy Joe Biden and the job that he didn’t do other than he did a good job for his son. He did a good job for son.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-phoenix-arizona-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa","Donald Trump Phoenix, Arizona Speech Transcript – Turning Point USA","11:04"
"Donald Trump","No, but I’m only here because of them. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be here. People were very unhappy. The fake news doesn’t report it. They were very unhappy. There was tremendous dissent, tremendous anger. A lot of people in this audience, I can tell you. But we’re here today to declare that we will never cave to the left wing and the left wing intolerance. We will never. We will never surrender to mob violence. And we will uphold American freedom, equality, and justice for every citizen of every background, very strong. That’s who we are. That is what we believe. And that is why we must prevail on November 3rd. We have to prevail, get out there. We’re honored to be joined by a great gentleman, a great governor of this state. He won by a lot of votes. And I said to him, “Governor, how am I doing?” He said, “You’re doing really well.” I said, “Good.” Because he knows better than anybody, he really has done a tremendous job as governor. Arizona Governor Doug Ducey. Where is Doug? Thank you, Doug. Thank you. And somebody who we need to keep in the Senate. A woman who works very hard. I just got back from something you like, the border wall. Martha McSally. Thank you, Martha. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Martha. We got to get her in.

We were beating them and they were having a tough year. 67. It was one of the worst years they had in 67 years and we were doing great. And then they said, “there’s a plague coming over from China. Here it comes.” What a disgrace. What a disgrace. And now you saw last week, the jobs numbers, the biggest ever. You saw the retail sales numbers, the biggest ever. Number one. And we’re going to have a very good third quarter. And interestingly, we’re going to have a good third quarter. And right when those numbers are announced, you have your election, so that’s hopefully a sign from up there.

We believe that the beloved heroes of American history should not be torn down by militant mobs, but held up as an example to the world. Now, they’re after George Washington. I said, “What did he do wrong? George Washington?” Thomas Jefferson. We stopped him. They were heading toward the Jefferson Memorial. They couldn’t care less. I think half of them don’t even know who Thomas Jefferson is. How about Ulysses S. Grant? They want the Confederate soldiers, but all of a sudden they go after Grant. But he’s the one that defeated the Confederate soldiers. What’s that all about? How about Gandhi? How about Churchill. You know Churchill, because this is going outside of our country.

Coronavirus. Kung flu. COVID-19. I said what’s the 19, COVID-19, some people can’t explain what the 19, give me… COVID-19, I said, “That’s an odd name.” I could give you many, many names. Some people call it the Chinese flu, the China flu.

"Donald Trump","I never said anything like it, but here’s the story. We are going to be stronger than ever before, and going to be soon. I think you’ll remember… Now Biden was going around like he’s a tough guy. He doesn’t know where the hell he is. Where? Where are you Joe? Joe, where are you Joe? Tell me where you are, Joe. But he’s going around, I stood up for China. No, his son walked out with 1.5 billion to manage, and what he did… Where’s Hunter? Remember? I said, “Where’s Hunter?” They came out with this t-shirt and some guy made a fortune, Where’s Hunter. By the way, Where is Hunter? He did well as Vice President, could you imagine how Hunter’s going to do if this guy ever won, and the father could honestly say, “I have no idea what’s going on.” He could raise his hand.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-phoenix-arizona-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa","Donald Trump Phoenix, Arizona Speech Transcript – Turning Point USA","36:50"

"Donald Trump","I stood up to China like no other administration in history. For decades they’ve ripped us off. They ripped us off like nobody. And I charged them a little thing called the massive tariffs. We took in billions and billions of dollars. They devalued their currency, and they like to say our people paid. No, no, our people didn’t pay. They devalued their currency in order to pay it, and they also put money out, otherwise they wouldn’t have been able to sell that product. But what happened for many years, there’s nobody ever that ripped off the United States like China. Nobody. So now we did a deal, but you know, the ink wasn’t dry when the plague flew in. The ink, wasn’t dry. The deal was great. Everybody was happy. I was thrilled. $250 billion worth of purchases over a short period of time. All grate. But the ink wasn’t dry, and we got hit by the plague. So I’m not too happy about that. But the long slow surrender is over because today and every day we are putting now America first.

"Donald Trump","We sparked a revolution in domestic energy production, and the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on planet earth. America, as of a couple of years ago is no longer energy dependent, we are now energy dominant. And because our energy use went down so much during this pandemic, it was a very, very bad period of time because we have 10 million jobs, energy jobs, and now we have the oil price up, where it should be, and yet people are paying very little for gasoline. That’s like the perfect thing.

And we created opportunities zones along with Tim Scott, and since then, countless jobs in $100 billion of new investment have poured into 9,000 of our most distressed neighborhoods in the country, 9,000. Opportunity Zones. So think of it. I did criminal justice reform. We did a lot of work on prison or prison reform. We did opportunity zones. Think of this. Think of all we’ve done, and we’ve taken care of the black colleges and universities, and nobody talks about it, but I have to talk about it. And you know what? Our black communities know it.

They will be obliterated. So we’re fighting for school choice because we know that access to education is a civil rights. School choice.

I never have a speech where not like live television. Sometimes you’ll have one where you can actually speak and you don’t have to worry about like one little slip, one tiny little slip, one word.

"Donald Trump","In response, we took swift and early action to ban travel from China, very, very early. Remember Nancy Pelosi and that crazy group. Nancy Pelosi, she wanted to dance in the streets of Chinatown and San Francisco, long after I ban China from coming here. We saved tens of thousands of lives with that early decision. And then we made an early decision on Europe. Yet liberal lawmakers and Democrat politicians condemned this policy to left rejected science in favor of their fanatical devotion to open borders. They want open borders, not just our Southern border. This is why the left is so dangerous. They always put their ideology before your safety. It’s crazy what’s going on.

I said, “Oh great. I just won the election. That’s great.” So in addition to issuing a series of aggressive travel bans, my administration launched the greatest national mobilization since World War II, we have done such a great job with this, between the ventilators and all of these things, including testing. We’re testing so much. We’re now up to 27.5 million tests. I thought it was 25, because it seemed like 25 million. 27, they just told me, 27.5 million tests. Now, when you have all those tests, you have more cases. So the news covers it, “They have more cases.” Well, yeah, if you’re going to do 20, and if let’s say other countries do 1 million, 2 million, big countries, 3 million.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-phoenix-arizona-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa","Donald Trump Phoenix, Arizona Speech Transcript – Turning Point USA","47:24"
"Donald Trump","Now four weeks ago, Germany was at 3 million tests. So I don’t know what they are now, but I know they’re not anywhere near where we are. So then they’ll say we have more cases. Now look, we want to do testing, we want to do everything, but they use it to make us look bad. But because of it, our mortality rate is so low. It’s so great what’s happening. So we want to test. So we do all these tests, and we find pockets, and we find people, and we find cases and they say the cases have jumped. Instead of saying what a job we’re doing with testing. But we did the job with testing. And we did ventilators. We came up with tests that nobody’s… We have so many different types of tests. We have the five minutes test, the 10 minutes test. We have tests, you send them to a public lab, a privately. We have tests.

Someday, it will be recognized by history, someday. But our actions and your selfless sacrifice. And that’s what has saved hundreds of thousands of lives. We had to do it and we did the right thing. I’ll tell you what we did the right thing. Now we open, we got to get it open because I said, I got to get it open. People need it.

They never needed all of them. In fact, they gave some to other people, but he didn’t need 40… 40,000 as opposed to 4,000 or 5,000, then it worked out great. Then he wanted a hospital built in the Javits Convention Center. We built it, but he didn’t use it. He could have used it for the older people. It was brand new, not infected, no infection. Then he wanted the boat. He wanted the boat to come up. Beautiful, beautiful hospital ship. You know what that is called, right? And it came up. They could have used it for senior citizens.

"Donald Trump","We’re helping other countries with ventilators because ventilators are very hard to make. They’re very complex. They are big and expensive and many countries are calling us, asking for help. They need ventilators and we’re able to do it because we’re making thousands of ventilators. Think of this thousands of ventilators a week. And to rescue the US economy, which is happening now. We pass over $3 trillion in relief measures. We suspended student loan payments and interest for college students. And to protect jobs for young Americans, just like you, we took historic action to block the entry of foreign workers into our nation. We believe that companies should hire American workers and American students first. They have to hire. We got to go American. We got to go American. We were down to 3.4, 3.5% unemployment and that’s one thing, but now we’ve got to get it back to those numbers. Then we can think, right? Then we can think about taking people in through merit, only through merit or mostly through a merit. I better say mostly because they’ll say that’s a terrible thing. You can’t make a little bit of a slip. They’ll say, “He said only what about this? What about that?” Generally speaking, we like merit. Okay. We want American students to fill American jobs. That’s the biggest difference between us and the left. We know that our first duty is to take care of our citizens, make America great again. So before the plague came in, we had the best of everything. We had the best interest rates. We had the best unemployment rates. We had the best job numbers ever. We had everything. Unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans had all reached the lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our country. It’s amazing how many categories, young people, young people without a high school diploma, young people without a college diploma. We were number one on every list you can think of. Women 75 years, not as good, I’m sorry. But it was getting ready to hit the all time. Women it was the best in 75 years. So I have to apologize. Can you believe that we did the best in 75 years and I apologize to women. But we were ready to hit the old time. And then we got hit by something that should have never happened because they could’ve stopped it. Young people have seen their wages rise by more than 10%.

And just to add the topping, as I mentioned, the 18% in retail sales, the surge was the biggest jump ever recorded in this country. The stock market in the last 50 days is the best stock market in history.

This is during hopefully the end of the pandemic, but as we fight to restore renew and rebuild our country, the hard left is trying to divide, denigrate, and destroy our country. The American people have watched in horror as left wing extremists have looted businesses, violently assaulted innocent civilians, and brutally injured hundreds and hundreds of police officers.

If a guy like Joe Biden gets in. Because Joe Biden has no control over what’s happening. They won’t even be talking to him. The murder rate in Detroit and Baltimore is higher than that of El Salvador, Guatemala, or Afghanistan. But the left launches no protests over these travesties. There are travesties. Because it doesn’t serve their radical agenda. Think of that, tougher than Afghanistan, all run by Democrats while their movement is based on hate. Ours is based on love. Love of our family.

Every American should take a long look at the bedlam in Seattle, because that’s exactly what will come to every city near you, every suburb and community in America.

Just we put you in for murder. It’s okay, come back, whenever you have a chance. You see what’s going on in some places like Philadelphia, what’s happening in Philadelphia.

Who’s getting them? Who is not getting them? Little section that’s Republican. Will they be stolen from mailboxes, as they get put in by the mailman? Will they be taken from the mailman and the mailwoman? Will they be forged? Who is signing them? Who’s signing them. What are they signed at a kitchen table and sent in? Will they be counterfeited by groups inside our nation? Will they be counterfeited maybe by the millions by foreign powers who don’t want to see Trump win?

A friend of mine who was a great guy, had a son who passed away seven years ago, seven years ago. He came to see me the other day. He said, “They just sent to my son Robert, a mail in ballot.” He died seven years ago. There’s no way they can control that. With mail in ballots, you introduce something in the middle of an election year and you have something where it’s very complex. You have no time to fix this very complex process. It’s very complex.

Some people just can’t make it to a polling station and they have good reason, but they have to go through this process in order to verify their identity.

I came in, I deployed the national guard very quickly. Mark Meadows was there. We had a lot of our people there. We stopped the violence. We saved that incredible statue you saw it last night.

We were posting advertisements in our free expression tunnel, where you’re allowed to paint whatever you want. We were making some advertisements and we had about 20 socialist thugs roll up from Antifa and from the young democratic socialists of America. Now for our trouble, of course, they roll up and attacked us. They started spraying all over the work that we had just done.

They let them in the room with us, they were protesting, screaming so loud that you could barely hear the speakers the entire time. And of course, NC State like many administrations across the country does the will of the radical left. Meanwhile, conservatives across the country are punished and blacklisted merely for expressing our own opinions. We’re ostracized and ousted with no support whatsoever from the administration. But let me tell you, when administrations across the country do the will of the left and cater to the mob. It’s our duty as conservatives to stand up and to fight for our rights and to fight for our nation and to fight for our guy.

I was mocked by a leftist on my campus, not for my conservative beliefs, but for a medical condition. I have the impacts, my hair growth and my ability to sweat.

"Chris Thomas","Imagine how much of a fit the mainstream media would have thrown if 15 to 20 kids in MAGA hats had come up and spray painted a kid in the eye and made someone else for a medical condition they have. Our school North Carolina State did not do anything about this. They didn’t discipline them. And it was no coincidence that the Antifa logo showed up on the free expression tunnel the next day. We are blessed to have a president like you, that is devoted to protecting free speech on college campuses. And thank you, president Trump and students for Trump, let’s keep America great.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-phoenix-arizona-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa","Donald Trump Phoenix, Arizona Speech Transcript – Turning Point USA","01:11:42"
"Donald Trump","Great job fellows. Thank you. So I signed an executive order, as you know, and based on what I’m just hearing, you should maybe be talking to Charlie or somebody around here about defunding that school. You can’t do that. Because that’s exactly what the executive order was based on. So you talked to the people, maybe have your father call us. His father’s a great Congressman, done a great job. So say hello to him. But you talk to them. That’s exactly what it was for. We did something that was radical, but it wasn’t radical to me. You have to be heard. And if you can’t be heard, let’s talk about it. Okay. As the radical left inflict violence on American streets, they’re also waging war on timeless American values like freedom of speech, which is what we’re just talking about.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-phoenix-arizona-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa","Donald Trump Phoenix, Arizona Speech Transcript – Turning Point USA","01:12:38"
"Donald Trump","Anyone who dares to speak the truth is canceled, censored, deplatformed, fired, expelled, harassed, abused, boycotted deprived of a livelihood or even physically assaulted. Those times will be changing very soon. You can judge a movement by its behavior and the young patriots here today, don’t destroy property. You don’t burn buildings, you don’t punish the centers, and you don’t try to erase the people with whom you disagree. It’s called civilized people. You’re civilized people. And yet, remember I said this, you’re civilized, but you’re much tougher than the other side. You’re much tougher, much tougher. You conduct yourselves with honor, integrity, and dignity because you know the truth, the facts, and the history all on your side. We’re joined today by Reagan Escada a student at Northwestern State University of Louisiana. Reagan became a target of liberal cancel culture when she dared to stand up for Christian…","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-phoenix-arizona-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa","Donald Trump Phoenix, Arizona Speech Transcript – Turning Point USA","01:13:36"
"Donald Trump","… Cancel culture when she dared to stand up for her Christian values, instead of bowing to political correctness. Reagan, please come up and say a few words please.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-phoenix-arizona-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa","Donald Trump Phoenix, Arizona Speech Transcript – Turning Point USA","01:15:03"
"Reagan Escudé","Well, thank you Mr. President for being here today with all of us, and for inviting me up here to tell of my experience with cancel culture. My name is Reagan Escudé, I graduated from Northwestern State University of Louisiana in 2019. I started my first job at a small private insurance company in Louisiana. A few weeks ago amidst all this chaos that we’re seeing with the Black Lives Matter movement, I made a video on my Instagram, and I talked about how disappointed I am in the church’s reaction to the Black Lives Matter movement. I’ve seen pastors call for white congregants to kneel and to apologize for the skin that God gave them. I addressed these evangelical pastors and leaders, and reminded them that racism is a problem in the heart. It is a sin problem that cannot be resolved by any law, protest or march. Of course my leftist followers didn’t appreciate this message at all. I had my name blasted all over social media, and people told me, “I’m ashamed if I’ve ever called you my friend. I’ve lost all respect for you.” I love y’all. An ex-coworker of mine made a post on Facebook about me calling me racist and homophobic. She listed my place of employment, and called for people to call my employer and have me fired. There were death threats made to the owners. There were threats to knock down the building, law enforcement had to get involved. Due to the crazy reaction from the leftist mob my employer told me that they came to the conclusion that they needed to terminate my employment. But here’s the thing, losing my job is a small price to pay when God’s name is being glorified. He will always make His name known.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-phoenix-arizona-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa","Donald Trump Phoenix, Arizona Speech Transcript – Turning Point USA","01:15:24"
"Reagan Escudé","But I share this story with you, because what happened to me is just a small example of something that’s happening on a much larger scale in our nation. Aunt Jemima was canceled. If you didn’t know Nancy Green, the original first Aunt Jemima, she was a picture of the American dream. She was a freed slave who went on to be the face of the pancake syrup that we love and have in our pantries today. She fought for equality, and now the leftist mob is trying to erase her legacy. Might I mentioned how privileged we are as a nation if our biggest concern is a bottle of pancake syrup. More recently, we’re seeing a call for statues of Jesus Christ to be torn down. Now I’m a little confused here because last week Jesus was a social justice warrior, and this week He’s the face of white supremacy.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-phoenix-arizona-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa","Donald Trump Phoenix, Arizona Speech Transcript – Turning Point USA","01:17:56"
"Reagan Escudé","Jimmy Kimmel has been calling our president racist for years, and it turns out he’s the racist. There’s governors that are getting away with wearing blackface that’s just sliding under the radar. I want to encourage you all to stand firm in your beliefs. We need truth. We need hard cold facts and truth now more than we ever have before, and we are so blessed to have a president who stands on the front lines, walks through the fire every day to fight for our God-given American freedoms. Do not apologize to the mob, and thank you President Trump for never apologizing to the mob. For always standing firm, for being here for the American people, and for fighting for our best interests because you are the change that we need to see in America. Thank you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-phoenix-arizona-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa","Donald Trump Phoenix, Arizona Speech Transcript – Turning Point USA","01:19:11"
"Donald Trump","Thank you Reagan. That was beautiful. As your story reminds us Reagan, true courage is defying the left’s orthodoxy, not submitting to it. We don’t submit, nobody should be submitting because we’re winning and we’re going to win, but you don’t submit to fake news progressive companies right there. They’re right back there watching us. Other institutions merely towing the left wing line have sacrificed their intellectual credibility and professional integrity. They have very little integrity left. Some of them have none. You’re the ones taking real risks. You’re showing real guts and making a virtuous stand.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-phoenix-arizona-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa","Donald Trump Phoenix, Arizona Speech Transcript – Turning Point USA","01:20:36"
"Donald Trump","With the rise of social media massive multinational tech companies have tried to clamp down on American democracy. That even means on me. As everyone knows, they’re using their enormous power to silence conservative voices, you know that. It’s not even close. I don’t even think they’re hiding it anymore. To protect our democracy I signed an executive order to remove legal protections for social media companies that unjustly censor American citizens. The radical left is also working to eliminate free speech on our college campuses. With us today is Nia Moore, a student at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota, whose experience is persecution firsthand. Nia, please come up, please.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-phoenix-arizona-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa","Donald Trump Phoenix, Arizona Speech Transcript – Turning Point USA","01:21:21"
"Nia Moore","First I just want to say thank you to Mr. President for having me on stage today. If you didn’t know much about Minnesota about a month ago, I’m sure you’ve seen us in the headlines over the past few weeks. The DFL is successfully moving our state farther to the left more and more each day. Now that isn’t because people aren’t conservative in Minnesota, it’s because they’re hell-bent on demonizing us at every turn. I began my career working in politics with Turning Point USA. Unfortunately, due to the leftist culture of my campus at North Hennepin, we were shut down almost immediately and were refused official recognition. I was told by the faculty that political groups were not welcome on campus. However, they had multiple leftist groups that supported the Black Lives Matter movement. They were pro-abortion, and they’ve advocated for Bernie Sanders.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-phoenix-arizona-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa","Donald Trump Phoenix, Arizona Speech Transcript – Turning Point USA","01:22:43"
"Nia Moore","Our governor, the mayor, sorry. Our governor, the mayor of Minneapolis, and the representative of the 5th Congressional District in Minnesota are all Democrats, but for whatever reason, the Republicans and the president take the blame for what has taken place. Unfortunately, the murder of George Floyd has created absolute chaos in my state of Minnesota. They have… Sorry I lost my place. Ever since the murder of George Floyd, I have not seen as much division, deceit and destruction in my life. Black Lives Matter only makes a scene during election years. How convenient that they made the biggest scene of all during the year of the most important election of our time? Black Lives Matter is only about police brutality once every four years. In between, they’re heavily funding a push for leftist and LGBTQ plus agendas.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-phoenix-arizona-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa","Donald Trump Phoenix, Arizona Speech Transcript – Turning Point USA","01:23:56"
"Nia Moore","The black community’s culture is naturally very conservative, so they mask their hidden agendas and play on the community’s biggest fear. If Black Lives Matter truly cared about black lives, they would not have allowed the riots to destroy black businesses and black communities. If they cared about black lives, they would defund planned parenthood. If Black Lives Matter cared about black lives, they would adjust the astronomically high numbers of black on black crime in inner cities. They try to paint us as the bad guys for not supporting the organization, but it’s not the saying black lives matter. I think there’s very few conservatives that believe black lives don’t matter. We do believe black lives matter, we just believe they all matter, not just the lives the left chooses to exploit.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-phoenix-arizona-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa","Donald Trump Phoenix, Arizona Speech Transcript – Turning Point USA","01:25:19"
"Nia Moore","I am a field director for Ilhan Omar’s challenger, Lacy Johnson. He’s the first Republican in Minnesota to have Black Lives Matter activists and lifelong Democrats want to hear what he has to say. Because of that, they’ve tried to silence us at every turn. People are fed up and they’re getting nervous. They will stop at nothing to keep their hold on us, even if that means lying to the very people they’re supposed to represent. Mr. President, I just want to say thank you for being a great example of a big-tent Republican. The president has never needed the black vote to win, but he’s still done incredible work with prison reform, lowering black unemployment, funding HBCUs, and stimulating the black community with Opportunities Zones. All without pandering. Once upon a time, the president asked the black community what we had to lose. We didn’t have anything, but now we do. Thank you Mr. President.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-phoenix-arizona-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa","Donald Trump Phoenix, Arizona Speech Transcript – Turning Point USA","01:26:46"
"Donald Trump","Thank you. Thank you Nia. Well Nia I want to just tell you, first of all thank you very much, and so heartfelt. I could see that. I also issued a historical executive order defending free speech and all of this is on college campuses. I will tell you that it’s something that’s being used by people like Charlie and used very well. It’s opening up a whole new voice, and it’s my honor to have done it under my order. Any college that refuses to let you speak stands to lose billions of dollars in terms of the [inaudible 01:29:15]. We’ve done a lot. We’ve really gone very far. We’ve taken it to a level that nobody’s ever taken it, and it’s my honor to have done it. It’s people like you that I do it for. When you think about it, it’s people like you. You’re going to be the ones, you’re going to be the ones that are at the crossroads of history. That’s where you are right now, you’re at a crossroads.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-phoenix-arizona-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa","Donald Trump Phoenix, Arizona Speech Transcript – Turning Point USA","01:28:26"
"Donald Trump","Everything our forefathers built, everything generations past, they shed their blood to defend the very survival of our freedoms, our rights and our republic. They’re all at stake. This is a very big time in our country. It’s a time like perhaps no other. But standing here before you today I have never been more confident that America will rise to new heights of greatness and glory. Because your generation is proving that your hearts are filled with the fire and the fervor of true American patriots. The great spirit of righteous defiance stirs deep within you I see that. It’s the same spirit that drove America’s founders and frontiersmen, people that built our nation. People that succeeded, people that worked hard, people that failed, people that failed. Some people failed and then they made it bigger than anyone would have ever believed possible. To defend all of your liberties, to secure your independence and establish this noble fortress of freedom.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-phoenix-arizona-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa","Donald Trump Phoenix, Arizona Speech Transcript – Turning Point USA","01:29:37"
"Donald Trump","It’s the same spirit that compels each of you to stand strong against the dull, mindless, soul-crushing conformity mandated by far left pundits, professors and liberal politicians. They’re taking our country in the wrong direction. It’s the same fierce and untamed American spirit that will lead the young patriotic Americans of this generation to serve our country, and you will serve it well, you will serve it so well. Together we will restore our economy quickly. We will rebuild our nation. We will revitalize our cities. We will take back our universities and colleges, and we will preserve the America we love for you and for your children.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-phoenix-arizona-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa","Donald Trump Phoenix, Arizona Speech Transcript – Turning Point USA","01:30:57"

Calling on the boldness and bravery of your generation, we will unite citizens of every race and color, religion and creed as one people, one family, and one extraordinary nation under God. With your help, this moment will be a turning point in American history that will be remembered and celebrated for generations to come for our young people, for our economy, for our communities and for our beloved country. The best is yet to come. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you very much.
