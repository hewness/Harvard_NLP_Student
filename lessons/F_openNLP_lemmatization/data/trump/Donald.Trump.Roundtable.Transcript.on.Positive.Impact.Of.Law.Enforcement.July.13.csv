"President Donald Trump","Thank you all very much for being at the White House; very special house, very special place. I’m grateful to be joined by citizens whose lives have been saved by law enforcement heroes. And that’s what they are the heroes. And they’re being very unfairly treated over the last long period of time, but over the last few years. It’s terrible what’s happening. We’re also joined by two amazing officers, South Carolina Deputy Sheriff William Kimbro. Where’s William? William. William. What happened to William? Okay. That’s a good excuse. That’s good. And Palm Beach County, Deputy Sheriff Corey Reese. Hi Corey, good.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-on-positive-impact-of-law-enforcement-july-13","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript on Positive Impact Of Law Enforcement July 13","00:02"
"President Donald Trump","In recent weeks, our country’s police officers have been really under siege. I want to thank … First of all, I do want to thank Vice President Pence for all the work he’s done on this. And in particular Attorney General Bill Barr, because the job he’s done has been amazing. It’s been 24 hours a day, I guess I could say 28 hours a day, right? It never ends, but it’s been a great job that you both done. We appreciate it, Mike. We appreciate it very much. But our officers have been under vicious assault and hundreds of police have been injured and several murdered. You’ve been reading about it, just like I’ve been seeing it. Reckless politicians have defamed our law enforcement heroes as the enemy. They call them the enemy.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-on-positive-impact-of-law-enforcement-july-13","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript on Positive Impact Of Law Enforcement July 13","00:55"
"President Donald Trump","They actually go and say that they’re enemy and even call them an invading army. These radical politicians want to defund and abolish the police from our nation. At first, when I first heard it, I said, “Well, that’s just something that they’re saying.” But they actually are trying to do it. You look at what’s going on in Minneapolis. You look at what’s going on in many Democrat run areas, but they want to defund and they want to abolish. Far-left mayors are escalating the anti-cop crusade and violent crime is spiraling in their cities. It’s all far left cities where they have no understanding of what has to be done. They don’t have a clue. I will say that we put on a very powerful rule in law that you get 10 years, you’re knocked down a monument. If it’s a federal monument, you go to jail for 10 years.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-on-positive-impact-of-law-enforcement-july-13","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript on Positive Impact Of Law Enforcement July 13","01:42"
"President Donald Trump","If it’s anything else, we tell them we work with the states to help them. But if you do anything where it’s a federal monument and there are a lot of them up there and nobody’s been attacked, nothing’s been attacked since we did, 10 years in jail, monument or statue. In one recent week in New York City, this is hard to believe, shootings were up 358%. And yet they spend all their time, they want to do Black Lives Matter signs outside of Trump Tower. That ought to spend their time doing something else, because I’ll tell you what, 358% increase in shootings in New York. Last month, over 300 people were shot. NYPD retirements have quadrupled and they’re going up even further. And New York City is out of control. Unfortunately, my place, I love it, but it’s out of control. It was doing so well. Rudy Giuliani, whether you like Rudy or not, he did a great job. He was the greatest mayor in the history of New York. Murders in Atlanta up 133% compared to the same period last year. And one of the victims was an eight year old girl. Then we’ve had younger than that in Chicago last weekend. In the last two weeks, 105 Americans were shot in Philadelphia. In Minneapolis, the city voted to disband the police department and cut it way down, but disband it ultimately. The radical politicians are waging war on innocent Americans. That’s what you’re doing when you play with the police. My administration is pro-safety, pro-police and anti-crime. And I will say, I just see a new number came in from Chicago, this weekend was a scourge. This weekend was, I guess, 20 people killed in many, many shootings. Many, many shootings, far worse than the last week.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-on-positive-impact-of-law-enforcement-july-13","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript on Positive Impact Of Law Enforcement July 13","02:36"
"President Donald Trump","Things are happening that nobody’s ever seen happening happen. In cities that are liberally run, I call them radical lib, and yet they’ll go and march on areas and rip everything down in front of them. If that’s what you want for a country, you probably have to vote for sleepy Joe Biden, because he doesn’t know what’s happening, but you’re not going to have it with me. We’ve been very strong on law enforcement. We’ll be doing things that you’ll be, I think very impressed with. Numbers are going to be coming down even if we have to go in and take over cities because we can’t let that happen. When you have 20 people killed, 22 people killed in one weekend in Chicago. When you have 88 shootings, it’s not even conceivable. That’s worse than Afghanistan. I hate to say it. That’s worse than any war zone that we’re in, by a lot.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-on-positive-impact-of-law-enforcement-july-13","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript on Positive Impact Of Law Enforcement July 13","04:25"
"President Donald Trump","It makes them look like tame places by comparison so we’re not going to let it go on. Supposed to wait for them to call, but they don’t call. We’ve asked Chicago, ” Would you like us to go in and help?” And they don’t want to say anything. We’ve called many of the cities. “Would you like us to go and help?” We’ve done a great job in Portland. Portland was totally out of control and they went in and I guess we have many people right now in jail and we very much quelled it. And if it starts again, well quell it again, very easily. It’s not hard to do if you know what you’re doing. I just want to thank everybody for being here. I’ll maybe ask Vice President Pence to say a couple of words, and then I’d like Bill Barr to say something and we’ll go around the room. Okay? Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-on-positive-impact-of-law-enforcement-july-13","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript on Positive Impact Of Law Enforcement July 13","05:19"
"Vice President Mike Pence","Thank you, Mr. President. It’s a real privilege to be here with the law enforcement officers who are gathered here and families whose lives have been impacted so profoundly by the courageous efforts of men and women in law enforcement. I can assure you that while some are talking about defunding the police, under this President and this administration, we’re going to defend the police. We’re going to back the blue because we understand that while tragedies happen and we’ll always look for ways that we can improve public safety and the President’s taken steps and taken executive action to provide new resources to improve public safety and law enforcement around the country. I want to assure you that you have a president who knows what the people gathered around this table know, is that most of the men and women who put on the uniform of law enforcement every day are the best people in this country. They risked their lives every day to make a difference in our communities just like they’ve made a difference in all of your lives.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-on-positive-impact-of-law-enforcement-july-13","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript on Positive Impact Of Law Enforcement July 13","06:03"
"Vice President Mike Pence","I want to thank you all. I want to thank you for being here for this conversation as the American people will greatly benefit by being reminded of the incredible contributions that our law enforcement community makes each and every day. I appreciate your willingness to tell that story. Thank you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-on-positive-impact-of-law-enforcement-july-13","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript on Positive Impact Of Law Enforcement July 13","07:13"

"Attorney General Bill Barr","Thank you, Mr. President. First, let me say what an honor it is for me to serve under a president who is such a strong supporter of law enforcement. I’ve said repeatedly that to my mind, there is no more noble profession in our country than serving as a law enforcement officer. The police put their lives and wellbeing on the line every day for us and their jobs have never been more difficult than it is today. Today we suffer many unprecedented social ills; kids growing up without fathers, alienated young angry men, gangs engaged in the most brutal kinds of violence, increasing mental illness and homelessness and a drug epidemic, inflicting casualties beyond anything that we’ve experienced in a major war, and an increase in sexual assaults and child exploitation. You name it. And who is expected to deal with all of this? As other institutions fail and abdicate their responsibility, who is expected to stand their ground and pick up the pieces? The police are.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-on-positive-impact-of-law-enforcement-july-13","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript on Positive Impact Of Law Enforcement July 13","07:37"
"Attorney General Bill Barr","And that’s why I say their job, the job we ask them to do today, has never been more challenging. I believe it’s important to understand that just like any other institution, there’s always room for improvement. And over the past several decades, there’s unquestionably been a lot of progress and reforms in policing, that’s improved policing and life for the officers, their families, and their communities. We have the most professional police in the world. Now obviously, the event in Minneapolis was ghastly, and I haven’t heard anyone attempt to defend it. And it has rightly brought about an urge to make sure that we continue reforming and we finish the job. And I think that law enforcement understands and agrees that the concerns of the African American community regarding excessive use of force must be addressed, but we also have to be careful and not throw the baby out with the bath water.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-on-positive-impact-of-law-enforcement-july-13","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript on Positive Impact Of Law Enforcement July 13","08:56"
"Attorney General Bill Barr","And so extremist reactions like defund the police are trying to pull us in exactly the opposite direction of where we have to go. We have to give law enforcement more support, more training and resources. I think the executive order that the president signed last month strikes exactly the right balance. It’s supportive of the police and it also addresses legitimate concerns about excessive force. Our nation needs to gain a renewed appreciation of the noble work done by our police officers in protecting our communities. I thank the president for convening this round table, to highlight the good work done by our men and women in blue. Thank you, Mr. President.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-on-positive-impact-of-law-enforcement-july-13","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript on Positive Impact Of Law Enforcement July 13","10:04"
"President Donald Trump","Thank you, Bill. I appreciate it. Maybe what we’ll do is we’ll go around the room and maybe you could introduce yourself and explain exactly what’s going on. You have an incredible story, please.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-on-positive-impact-of-law-enforcement-july-13","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript on Positive Impact Of Law Enforcement July 13","10:52"

"Sarah Bohan","Forgot to introduce myself, sorry. Sarah [Bohan 00:14:02]. We have four kids and we’re from Roanoke, Virginia. I was laying in bed and my sister happened to be home and my husband ended up calling her and asking her to count how many kids were home and she got up and looked inside of my boy Spencer’s room and he was not there and his window was open, and so we instantly saw that he was missing, and he is autistic non-verbal and doesn’t really have a sense of danger. So when he goes missing, it’s like life or death, you got to find him as fast as you possibly can. So we instantly called the police and my husband rushed home from work and they called the search dogs out and within 12 minutes, they found him. He had ran up into the woods. Someone had spotted him sitting in the middle of the road and he pulled over and they tried to get him to come to him but of course he bolted and ran up into the woods and following behind the dog going in and out of the trees, it was actually really cool because I could imagine him doing that exact thing of going in and out of the trees and sliding down the creeks and I’m sure he was having the time of his life because he was free but we were able to find him and the dog’s ears perked up right when he was within 15 feet and I yelled his name and he sat down and instantly ran over to him and we were able to carry him back and he was safe and the only thing he had on him was four ticks, so he was good.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-on-positive-impact-of-law-enforcement-july-13","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript on Positive Impact Of Law Enforcement July 13","14:03"

"Rhonda Norris","My name is Rhonda Norris. My story started when I was coming here from school one day. I teach and I was broad-sided in an intersection by a truck who ran a red light. I have no recollection of the accident. My first memory was a policeman reaching through the shattered window and checking for a pulse and I was in and out of consciousness and he continuously urged me to stay awake and stay with him. Very soothing, very calm, and he was calling on his radio for an ambulance and first responders which his being there sped up the process dramatically. He’s the one who told me we’re going to put a sheet over you to cut you out of the vehicle. I couldn’t move, I was trapped in the vehicle and also my injuries made me incapable of movement. He also followed the ambulance to the hospital. He gathered up all my personal belongings that he could find at the accident and brought them to my husband at the hospital and explained to him that I had regained consciousness. I stayed with my husband until the tests were done and they said she’s going to be okay.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-on-positive-impact-of-law-enforcement-july-13","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript on Positive Impact Of Law Enforcement July 13","20:47"

"Perry Cleek","Our church watched over the last few weeks at the way that our police officers were treated all over the country and it was all over the news about how they are such … They’ve been demonized and disgraced and dishonored and we got our heads together and thought, “What can we do as a small church in a small town to honor our police and to let our voice be known?” Their voice is loud that blame all this on police officers. The voice of small town America is seldom heard, so we just set up a little ceremony. We went through the chief of police and the public safety director, and we asked them if we could hold a public ceremony on the steps of the courthouse on Main Street in Jonesboro on July 4 at 11:00 in the morning and present each member of the Jonesboro Police Department with a check for $1,000.00. We did that and it shouldn’t have but it made national news. I think small towns all over America feel like we do, that we want our voice to be heard that we love law enforcement, our local police officers, and if we can do something to support them and encourage them, then that’s what we want to do, and we feel very good about what we did.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-on-positive-impact-of-law-enforcement-july-13","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript on Positive Impact Of Law Enforcement July 13","22:51"

I thought you were going to tell me that they wanted to arrest you for giving them a couple of bucks and they deserve it very much but you know I’ve heard the other end of those stories also. You’re not allowed to do anything and you’re right about it. What the police have been going through over the last number of years in all fairness, it’s been starting but it’s never been like this, has it? It’s never been like this. It’s crazy. It’s crazy and they’ll find out it will go the opposite direction unfortunately at some point. It will go absolutely opposite when they see … You’re going to have some defunding and abolishing and you’ll see numbers like nobody would ever believe and they’re going to say, “Let’s get our police back as soon as we can.” That’s great what you just … That’s a fantastic thing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-on-positive-impact-of-law-enforcement-july-13","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript on Positive Impact Of Law Enforcement July 13","24:12"

"Debbie Wisner","And Mr. Vice President for having us. My name is Debbie [Wisner 00:25:54]. I’m local, I live in Maryland and my story is not very dramatic. It’s just one that my purse was stolen. My purse. People have it happen to them. My credit cards were canceled and my cellphone, we put a special note on it that said if found please call this number. Nothing came up then.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-on-positive-impact-of-law-enforcement-july-13","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript on Positive Impact Of Law Enforcement July 13","25:50"
"Debbie Wisner","A couple nights later in the middle of the night at midnight, the phone rings and a gentleman says, “I found your phone. I have your phone. Would you offer a reward for it?” I said, “Of course.” My husband said, “Are you nuts?” He said, “I’ll bring it to you.” I gave him my address and hung up the phone and called our police department. Because that’s who we turn to when there’s a situation. My husband had another idea. He wanted to do something else but I said, “No, we’re going to let the police do this. There’s no shooting tonight.” So the police came, they gave us their cellphone number, they went away around the corner and they said, “When he pulls up give us a ring. We’ll be there.” Sure enough, he pulled up, he comes out of the car, it’s 2:00 in the morning now, and the police, two squad cars were there immediately which is what we need in our communities and they checked him out. He did in fact find the phone and I gave him a reward and thanked my police officers and I’m grateful that we have community policemen that are willing to come at two in the morning and do this silly thing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-on-positive-impact-of-law-enforcement-july-13","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript on Positive Impact Of Law Enforcement July 13","26:14"

I have 12 years experience in the Georgia House of Representatives, eight years as County Exec. As County Exec, I’ve had to manage a very large, probably one of the largest police departments in the state of Georgia, but I’ve also had the unfortunate experience of having to meet with family members who lost a loved one from a police shooting. That was probably the most difficult part of my job.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-on-positive-impact-of-law-enforcement-july-13","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript on Positive Impact Of Law Enforcement July 13","28:17"
"Speaker 1","But I’ve also had to deal on other side where I lost two police officers in one night among several others I lost. But, I lost two in one night. By the way, they happened to have been African American and going to meet with their family members as well, young wives with young babies and having to experience seeing them lose a loved one is nothing anybody would want to do.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-on-positive-impact-of-law-enforcement-july-13","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript on Positive Impact Of Law Enforcement July 13","28:53"
"Speaker 1","But I can tell you this, Mr. President, by and large, most law enforcement officers, those men and women who honorably wear their uniforms each and every day to go out when they’re running towards a situation, others are running from it, so we have to stand with them. I’ll say this, I have two words. We need more funding for police officers, not less funding and here’s why I say that. When you look at law enforcement and the equipment, that’s important for them because it’s to protect and save their lives as well as saving others lives. But clearly more money is needed to buy less lethal enforcement types of tools like the Bola, what they call the BolaWrap.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-on-positive-impact-of-law-enforcement-july-13","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript on Positive Impact Of Law Enforcement July 13","29:18"
"Speaker 1","We also need resources for them. Officers usually, almost always only get the psychological exam prior of being hired as part of the examination of getting hired. But afterwards, they’re not given those type of psychological exams or assessments. When you look at them, they’ve been on the, let’s say, the beat four or five years nonstop and the number of calls they’re getting, number of situations, that’s the way we can detect are they burnt out? Do we need to put him somewhere else? That’s important.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-on-positive-impact-of-law-enforcement-july-13","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript on Positive Impact Of Law Enforcement July 13","30:05"
"Speaker 1","Finally, Mr. President, community policing is important, that relationship, that trust being fair, but enforcing the law. Most people, including black people, they want law enforcement to be out there enforcing the law. I think they want them to be fair. They want them to be swift in justice. We lost a baby girl too in Atlanta, eight years old and it wasn’t to a police officer. More people have died from the protest of Black Lives Matter than prior to that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-on-positive-impact-of-law-enforcement-july-13","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript on Positive Impact Of Law Enforcement July 13","30:33"

"Susan Young","Good afternoon, President Trump, Vice President Pence and Mr. Barr and distinguished guests. I thank you for this opportunity to share our family’s story. Eight years ago, our 15-year-old daughter was trafficked by MS-13 gang members. She was trafficked over a year and a half time period throughout the DMV area. Law enforcement played a fundamental role in the rescue and the recovery of our daughter and were also vital in the protection and safety of our family, both then and now.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-on-positive-impact-of-law-enforcement-july-13","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript on Positive Impact Of Law Enforcement July 13","31:23"
"Susan Young","Initially the officer’s handling our case, albeit well-intentioned, we’re not trauma-informed and not able to differentiate a runaway team from a victim of human trafficking. Once we came in contact with trained personnel, former detective Bill Wolf, our situation improved. We need to provide resources and training to law enforcement to properly address not only the offenders, but also to the victims and to their families.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-on-positive-impact-of-law-enforcement-july-13","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript on Positive Impact Of Law Enforcement July 13","32:01"
"Susan Young","Because of Mr. Wolf’s expertise in this area, we were able to relocate our family to a safe location. We were able to get our daughter the proper resources and help so that she could heal and move on for her life. The law enforcement is crucial to the rescue, to the victims of human trafficking and I believe we should support them with everything we have.

I’ve spent some time on the road and with my colleague, Scott Turner, trying to get local leadership to work with us to not only change those communities, but empower people. But having these sessions here is extremely important because most people don’t know. Some people don’t know the pain that you all go through.

I closed the border, as you know, to China. I closed. I did the ban on China, heavily infected and we saved tens of thousands of lives and Dr. Fauci will admit that it was a good decision. It was very early.

They decided to take a view on it and they decided that he should be… they were going to drop the case.

"President Donald Trump","You know that we have one of the lowest mortality rates anywhere. If you know Biden and Obama stopped their testing, they just stopped it. You probably know that. I’m sure you don’t want to report it, but they stopped testing right in the middle. They just went, “No more testing,” and on a much lesser problem than the problem that we have, obviously, with respect to… this is the worst thing that’s happened since probably 1917. This is very bad. All over the world, there’s 188 countries right now.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-on-positive-impact-of-law-enforcement-july-13","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript on Positive Impact Of Law Enforcement July 13","42:55"
"President Donald Trump","But no, we test more than anybody by far. And when you test, you create cases. So we’ve created cases. I can tell you some countries they test when somebody walks into a hospital sick or walks into maybe a doctor’s office, but usually a hospital, that’s the testing they do, so they don’t have cases, whereas we do. We have all of these cases, so it’s a double edged sword. At the same time, we have the lowest mortality or just about the lowest mortality in the world. We’re doing a great job. We’re doing very well with vaccines and we’re doing very, very well with therapeutics. And I think we’re going to have some very good information coming out soon.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-on-positive-impact-of-law-enforcement-july-13","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript on Positive Impact Of Law Enforcement July 13","43:27"
"President Donald Trump","But we have the best and certainly the biggest, by far the biggest testing program anywhere in the world. If you tested China or Russia or any of the larger countries, if you tested India, as an example, the way we test you’d see numbers that would be very surprising. Brazil too. Brazil is going through a big problem, but they don’t do testing like we do. We do the testing and by doing the testing, we have tremendous numbers of cases. If we didn’t do this… as an example, we’ve done 45 million tests. If we did half that number, you’d have half the cases probably around that number. If we did another half of that, you’d have half the numbers. Everyone would be saying, “Oh, we’re doing so well on cases.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-on-positive-impact-of-law-enforcement-july-13","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript on Positive Impact Of Law Enforcement July 13","44:05"
"President Donald Trump","But when I see it reported in the night, you can check me out of this. I mean, they always talk about… they’re always talking about cases, the number of cases. Well, it is a big factor that we do. We have a lot of cases because we have a lot of testing, far more than any other country in the world. And it’s also the best testing. Yeah.

And this is an investigation that they said should have ended before it started. It shouldn’t have started, and if it did, it should have ended immediately because they found, as you know, as well as I do, they found nothing initially, but it went on for two years or longer.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-on-positive-impact-of-law-enforcement-july-13","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript on Positive Impact Of Law Enforcement July 13","46:20"

He wasn’t given another trial. He should have been given another trial. I won’t say more. I won’t talk about the judge. I’m not going to. Why would I ever talk about a judge? But this was a judge that gave, I believe solitary confinement to Paul Manafort. Al Capone didn’t have solitary confinement. These are things that happened.

Two months ago, I saved the oil industry. There would have been… I created it. We became number one, we have millions of jobs and we saved it. Texas is not going to have to let go of millions and millions of people. Oklahoma, North Dakota, many states. We’re $40 a barrel. And yet you can buy gasoline for under $2. Nobody’s ever seen like this. We have the biggest energy in the world. When number one oil as you know, oil and gas by far. We’re now number one in the world. And we would have had millions of people out of work. I saved it. And then they say I’m leading by one point in Texas. They said it last time too. They said, Texas is too close to call.

When you think of that with thousands of lives and you have one person that was under 18, that’s something, that tells you for some reason, I guess, the immune system is much stronger with young people than it is for others. We have to watch the group that does have the difficulty, does have the problem. We all know what that is. We all know who they are, especially if they have a medical problem.

But I think they feel that by keeping schools closed, that’s a bad thing for the country and therefore that’s a good thing for them. But they’re the ones who city’s burning.

We built the greatest economy in history, greatest economy we’ve ever had, the greatest economy the world has ever seen. And then the plague came in from China and we started… we did the right thing.
