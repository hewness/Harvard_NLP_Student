He was fighting this young superstar who was going to be great. Right? They would tell me how great he is. Man, I mean, I don’t want to hurt anybody’s feelings, but he was supposed to be the future of the UFC, but he had to go through this guy right here. Didn’t work out too well, did it, Jorge?

They champion our shared values and embody the American dream. That’s what it is. I mean, this guy was a fighter on the street. He used to beat up people. Your route is much different. I know your story. Actually, for what you do, it’s sort of cool. For other people, it wouldn’t be so good, but he used to beat up people, and somebody said, “Hey, come on to the gym.

But these are all different stories, right? All different stories. Whatever it takes, Jorge, right? Whatever it takes. But Joe Biden has spent 47 years selling out to the different interests in Washington. It’s really sad. He sold out the Hispanic American community, sending your jobs to China, making your communities less safe, attacking your religious values and trapping countless children in failing government schools.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-latinos-for-trump-roundtable-event-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump ‘Latinos for Trump’ Roundtable Event Transcript September 25","06:22"

The radical left can’t have it, and you know about the radical left. Almost more than any people, you know about the radical left. You’ve gotten some pretty big examples, and you’re not going to be there, and I think that’s one of the reasons we’re doing so well with Hispanics. Joe Biden betrayed Hispanic Americans, and I’m fighting for you, and we’re fighting like never before. We can’t let anything happen. I think this will go down, and I think right now, people are saying, it’s the most important election in the history of our country because they are stone cold crazy, what they’ll do to our country. You see it on the streets. You see it with the riots all the time, and we don’t have that in Republican states and cities. You don’t have that. This is endemic to the Democrats, and no bail, no this, no that, weakness all over the place, and they take advantage. And that’s the way it is, and it’s a very sad thing. We go in. We went into Minneapolis. We saved it. We went in. They knew we were coming into Seattle.

I love New York, and you look at what they’ve done, the Democrats and what they’ve done, to destroy it. They have some categories of crime up 160 percent. One was up 300 percent.

Third quarter numbers will be announced before the election, and I think they’re going to be great. They’re going to be great. I think that GDP is going to … I mean, estimates are from … I heard one from 23 percent to 35 percent, and any one of them would be an all time record worldwide, but that’s what the predictions are.

That’s what happened. They ended the tax bill. You’re nodding, and you understand exactly. They just cut it, and that was Biden and his friends.

I just got the Bay of Pigs award, and I’ve gotten it twice now, twice, and I got the total endorsement of the Cuban population, as you know. They were up two days ago in the White House, and they gave us the endorsement, so we’re doing great with that. But we also announced for Puerto Rico $13 billion in historic disaster relief fund, so this is done by Trump. This is not done by the Democrats, but you have to explain that. And especially to those in the Puerto Rican community living in Florida, we have to explain that to them, because if I don’t get elected, you’re not doing anything with the pharmaceuticals again.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-latinos-for-trump-roundtable-event-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump ‘Latinos for Trump’ Roundtable Event Transcript September 25","12:00"

They don’t want people coming into the country that are going to take their jobs, and they understand it better, and I always thought it would be the opposite in a way.

It would be great if the main stream media would do something about it, but they tend not to. But again, I want to commend Katherine Harris of CBS, she did an incredible piece on this.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-latinos-for-trump-roundtable-event-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump ‘Latinos for Trump’ Roundtable Event Transcript September 25","19:41"
"Donald Trump","Can’t believe it. The last administration also surrendered to the Narco terrorists of Columbia. Anybody from Columbia? Well, you know what’s going on there, right? You know what’s going on there. Joe Biden even received the endorsement of Columbian socialist, Gustavo Pedro. Not good, right? Not a good endorsement. A former member of M-19 guerrilla organization, right? No good, right? Good, he knows. Under my administration we work with our Colombian partners to stabilize the regions, which we’ve largely done and launched a historic naval operation against the drug traffickers. And have taken in tons and tons of really bad stuff. The Obama, Biden administrations horrendous Cuba policy betrayed the Cuban people. And enriched Castro’s regime. I ended that and as you know, we ended it very strongly. We ended it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-latinos-for-trump-roundtable-event-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump ‘Latinos for Trump’ Roundtable Event Transcript September 25","20:56"
"Donald Trump","And we stand with every citizen of Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela in their fight for freedom. This location is called, Little Venezuela, did you know that? There’s so many Venezuelans and they love me because I did a great job with this place. They liked me before already. This is Little Venezuela, it has a tremendous Venezuelan population in the Dural section of Miami. And if you put up a house for sale, they say that if it takes more than two days to sell, you’re doing something wrong. No, it’s true. It’s just a great location and incredible neighbors, incredible people. And I’ve gotten to know them really well because of this and they’re great. And it’s going to work out very well. So we’ve achieved more, I’ve achieved more for the Hispanic Americans. And think of it, I’ve achieved more for Hispanic Americans in 47 months, than Joe Biden has achieved in 47 years. I’ve been here for 47 months.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-latinos-for-trump-roundtable-event-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump ‘Latinos for Trump’ Roundtable Event Transcript September 25","21:56"
"Donald Trump","It’s amazing, 47, 47 but he’s been doing it for 47 years. I always get a kick, I see him, “Well, we should do this. And we should do that.” I said, “You’ve been doing this for 47 years, and now you’re going to do it?” And he’s not exactly primetime, little like a fighter. Someday I’m going to say, “You know, you got to take it easy now, little guy.” Right now he’s prime time but there’ll be a time, it happens. This is not prime time for Joe. He never had too much of a prime time. But I will say this 47 months and 47 years, it’s true, we’ve done more. So what we’re going to do now, we’re going to go around the table a little bit to say a few words. Maybe we can take some questions from the audience if we can, we’ll do it fast. If we go fast, we can take a couple of questions from them. And it’s really great to be here with you. And I appreciate your support. Great to be with you. Okay. Why don’t we start right there? Go ahead, we’ll go fast and we’ll take a couple of questions.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-latinos-for-trump-roundtable-event-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump ‘Latinos for Trump’ Roundtable Event Transcript September 25","23:12"

"Donald Trump","Good morning, hi.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-latinos-for-trump-roundtable-event-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump ‘Latinos for Trump’ Roundtable Event Transcript September 25","24:03"
"Santiago","I’m usually a construction guy, you never see me wearing a suit like this.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-latinos-for-trump-roundtable-event-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump ‘Latinos for Trump’ Roundtable Event Transcript September 25","24:14"
"Donald Trump","I know that, that’s true.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-latinos-for-trump-roundtable-event-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump ‘Latinos for Trump’ Roundtable Event Transcript September 25","24:17"
"Santiago","Actually true story, I just bought it two days ago, so I hope it looks good. My name is Santiago Solleta, I own a small construction firm in central Florida. We do concrete work, sidewalks, walls for highways, bridges, County work, City work. And really having a company has always been the dream of my life, especially given my background. So I was born in Columbia, in the early 80s, where the violence, it was a terrible… A terrible time, I actually lost my father at the age of seven to the violence. And my mother was a single mother at the time with a five-year old and a seven year old to support us. She did an amazing job. Luckily, we had the great opportunity to come to the United States when I was 15. My brother was 13 years old. We moved to the United States. And out of all the places in the United States that a Latino family, not speaking English, not knowing the culture could have land, we ended up in Mobile, Alabama. Talk about a culture shock, but what a blessing that was, that place, some beautiful people. We ran across some amazing people that supported us along the way. And then from there, I went to the university of Florida and graduated. Graduated with a degree of civil engineering. And then I started working for one of the largest contractors in the US, building roads, light rails highways, but I always had that dream in the back of my mind, of owning my own company. And a few years ago, with my wife, we decided to make the jump and go for it. It was pretty scary, but the economy was so strong that it was the right time. And it’s really rewarding, but it has some tough days. And a lot of times you hear politicians and people talk about, what they do for the small businesses and small businesses are the core of the economy. But in my opinion, Mr. President, what you’ve done with this mold, with the tax cuts for the small businesses, have been the greatest achievement done in years.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-latinos-for-trump-roundtable-event-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump ‘Latinos for Trump’ Roundtable Event Transcript September 25","24:18"
"Santiago","I tell you why because a lot of people talk but there hasn’t really been tangible change. But the tax cut is real dollars. Real dollars that go into businesses to reinvest. For me, it means having a little extra cash in the bank at the end of the day to give bonuses to my guys, because they deserve it, they deserve more than that, God knows that. So it’s amazing, the tax cuts, it’s amazing for small businesses. So thank you for that, Mr. President, and giving me the ability to grow my business, to take larger projects, to invest in equipment and the people. So thank you for that. And I hope people understand the importance of continuity. We have to keep this fight, we have to keep the tax reform and the help to the small businesses for years to come.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-latinos-for-trump-roundtable-event-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump ‘Latinos for Trump’ Roundtable Event Transcript September 25","26:47"
"Donald Trump","Right. So those tax cuts that help so many businesses, including small businesses, they will be gone if Biden gets it, you know they’re going to wipe you out. So just remember that. And it won’t be the same. You’ll be losing a lot of jobs. So, that’s the way it works, it’s unfortunate. Thank you. Great job, appreciate it. Please.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-latinos-for-trump-roundtable-event-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump ‘Latinos for Trump’ Roundtable Event Transcript September 25","27:53"

My name is Erica Benfield and I’m a Puerto Rican moved state side at just six years old. Like many of us on this panel, we came here for the American dream. That’s not the only start to my story. It goes back one generation back. My grandfather was a prisoner of war in Korea for two years, [inaudible 00:11:47]. And when I saw what you and your administration did in returning the bodies to his comrades and others who couldn’t make it back on their own, it meant a lot to me.

"Erica","During the Obama administration, there were hardly any loans for a business like mine. I didn’t qualify, but it was tough, but we did it. I had an intern and myself, and we started in less than 500 square feet. 12 years later, Florida living quarters, FLQ interiors, thanks to you and your administration, qualified for our first SBA loan. That 500 square foot store is now 5,000 square feet. 10 times the size in 12 years.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-latinos-for-trump-roundtable-event-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump ‘Latinos for Trump’ Roundtable Event Transcript September 25","29:29"

"Erica","It doesn’t end there. I signed an exclusivity to sell only American made blinds, shades and shutters. I said no to China. I will not sell Chinese products in my store. Lat year, in one year, we saw 300% growth. When COVID-19 hit, we were the second quarter into our newly expanded showroom, and we had to make tough choices. I still remember the words from Congressman Waltz, keep pushing, the second wave of PPP is coming. And thanks to you and your administration, we qualified not only for the PPP loan, but also for the SBA loan forgiveness for six months.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-latinos-for-trump-roundtable-event-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump ‘Latinos for Trump’ Roundtable Event Transcript September 25","30:18"
"Erica","True story. It saved every job, even our intern from the local college. Mr. President, I want to thank you personally because I feel that you’ve done more than what you promised. You say promises made, promises kept, but you did more than that for a business like mine. But it doesn’t end there. Like you, in 2016, I ran for office for the first time and was elected as the first Latina, Hispanic elected official in the city of De Berry.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-latinos-for-trump-roundtable-event-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump ‘Latinos for Trump’ Roundtable Event Transcript September 25","31:27"
"Erica","Not one business has permanently closed in our city. And I believe that because we have kept taxes low, we have the lowest crime rate in the state of Florida and our people help each other. Under the leadership of governor DeSantis, we are investing and bringing more people to Florida. I’m not a polished politician, I’m probably more nervous than anyone up here on this panel, because it’s only been four years, but you do a really good job, Mr. President. I invite you to visit De Berry and Volusia County again, the home of NASCAR. And let me tell you, the beast makes one hell of a pace car. Because I was there, I don’t like heights and I strapped in my seat and it was there for that beautiful patriotic moment, high up in the bleachers, bringing you into our County.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-latinos-for-trump-roundtable-event-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump ‘Latinos for Trump’ Roundtable Event Transcript September 25","32:21"

We work worldwide, actually, worked on 45 countries from here. We also have operations in Chile, Colombia, and Mexico. I have to say first, that our company really, received a wonderful help you see, from the central government. It was not promises, it was true.

I want to say also, that I am the president of the Colombian-American Chamber of Commerce, here in Miami. And all the companies that we support, which are established here, have been also helped a lot by the government.

"Donald Trump","Thank you very much. I used to say, and I meant it, but I didn’t know it had such meaning, that we could be a Venezuela too. Venezuela 15 years ago, was a very wealthy country and a very, very wealthy country, prosperous, talked about all over the world, one of the wealthiest and just looked like it had a tremendous future. And then all of a sudden, they went with a different ideology and right, now we send water, we send food, they don’t have anything. They don’t have medicine, they don’t have … they literally don’t have water and they have oil, so it’s not just the oil. I mean, they haven’t done anything right with the oil. They don’t know what is happening in that country. That country is a total disaster. It could happen. It could happen, because if you look at some of these people that you see with the storefronts and breaking down and the riots and everything that’s going on, it’s the same ideology.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-latinos-for-trump-roundtable-event-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump ‘Latinos for Trump’ Roundtable Event Transcript September 25","37:06"
"Donald Trump","That’s what happened with the Venezuela. One day it was gone, it was just gone. And so, it could happen here. This would be a Venezuela on a major steroid. Okay, this would be a Venezuela, that would be a very large version of it, but it could happen. And a year ago, I started saying that two years ago, it could happen because I’d see the thinking. I’d see some of this thinking and I say, “That could actually happen. That could actually happen.” But we’re not going to let it happen. Doesn’t happen, with me it doesn’t happen. You put the wrong people in office, it could happen. It could happen rapidly. Okay, let’s go.

"Claudia","I moved to this country, the land of the free, as you call it, 18 years ago, 2002. And I married a wonderful man, have two wonderful kids and we both had a background in manufacturing. So we decided to start a business here in the United States and also in Honduras. We did both. But in 2015, when you started running for president, and you started promoting the Made in USA and Made in USA was like, this is the moment, it’s coming. So we decided to start … take the risk and do some investment here and buying some equipment and taking advantage of that [inaudible 00:39:44] that we had in buying equipment. That helped us a lot, because we thought it was the right moment to move and start investing, like in high equipment, because what we’re doing is printing fabrics and in clothing. Our business name is, [the Signers 00:06:02] manufacturer, we created that business back in 2016.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-latinos-for-trump-roundtable-event-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump ‘Latinos for Trump’ Roundtable Event Transcript September 25","38:56"
"Claudia","So we started bringing more equipment, getting ready for what is coming. And now, after your three years, almost four years of residency, we noticed how everything is coming back right now, how businesses were booming, even right now, with all these problems that we have with the COVID. We noticed how many factories and business are calling us, that they want to bring their business back to America. They said, “We don’t want to made in China, we want to …” Yes. This was something that we were serious, not every day, but every week Mr. President, we received calls from different companies that they want to say, “We want our products made in USA. We don’t care if we have to pay more, but we want to manufacture here.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-latinos-for-trump-roundtable-event-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump ‘Latinos for Trump’ Roundtable Event Transcript September 25","40:07"
"Claudia","So, that’s why we took the chance. And we said, “Okay, let’s add manufacturing. Let’s add sewing, let’s add cutting.” So we added more to our businesses, and now, it’s so much business that we’re be getting from overseas and also local business that we don’t have enough … We have more demand than we can to hire people, like we’re lack of personnel right now. We need more people, because in this business that we have right now which is manufacturing, this business was gone long ago. In the eighties, when all this CAFTA and NAFTA, and all these agreements. All these business were lost. Everything left, and so the people that we need right now, need the training because nobody knows how to do this. Nobody knows how to do the sewing, the cutting, all the integral part that we need. So, we’re trying to train people now, but we’re willing to do it because some of demand that we have right now, that we’re willing to do that and Made in America is excellent.

And it’s a fantastic deal, you’ll see that. It just kicked in and everyone said that couldn’t be done, there’s no way to get rid of the NAFTA deal. It was a terrible deal. We lost so much business to Mexico and so much business to Canada. And I was able to get that done. We got it actually passed and it’s, USMCA is now the deal and it’s great for our country and it’s going to keep our businesses in our country. And it was a great achievement.

"Carolina Ferreiro","Thank you, Mr. President. My name is Carolina Ferreiro, and I came from Havana, Cuba, 36 years ago. I came at the age of six with my parents and my little sister fleeing, obviously, the horrible Castro regime. This country is where that gave us the freedom that we wanted to thrive. It’s where our family grew our faith and we dreamed of a better generation to come. Our family business is Pharma Natural. We make the best vitamins in America here in Miami Lakes, Florida. And this year, with the Care Act… I mean, with the acts… Sorry, with the tax cuts and the job acts, we were able to expand, give back to our employees, add jobs, but then COVID came, and everything was uncertain. But with your quick actions and your awesome leadership, Mr. President, we were able to get PPP and saved many, many jobs. As a result, we answered your call when you said to the private sector, “Help.” So we stopped making some vitamins, and we started making some hand sanitizers for our first responders.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-latinos-for-trump-roundtable-event-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump ‘Latinos for Trump’ Roundtable Event Transcript September 25","51:27"
"Carolina Ferreiro","Although we manufacture here in the USA and made in USA, we still, for the last 18 years, our company has depended on China for the components and for soft gels and gummies. This year, we’re taking the leap and we’re expanding operations, and we’re bringing gummies and soft gels to our manufacturing facilities so we no longer can depend on China.

"Fabio Andretti","Good morning, Mr. President. I am honored and humbled to be a part of this very distinguished table, especially with all our guests. I know Cubans told Venezuelans, “Be careful with Maduro” Venezuelans and now Cuban Americans are telling Colombians, “Be careful with Pedro.” We hear you. We hear you. My name is Fabio Andretti. I’m a Colombian American, and I’m a [Ulista 00:53:50], a true believer like many Columbian Americans in Florida of former President Libe who is the wall in Columbia to start [inaudible 00:54:01]. That has been trying to take over our country and is moving to the United States.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-latinos-for-trump-roundtable-event-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump ‘Latinos for Trump’ Roundtable Event Transcript September 25","53:25"
"Fabio Andretti","We appreciate and want to thank Vice President Pence for his support to Libe by tweeting that he should be able to defend himself in freedom. There is a real threat in Columbia with the leftist senators and terrorists that are in Congress, especially Pedro, an ally of Maduro. Not only is he supporting Biden, but he also has people in Miami that are participating in demonstrations asking for votes for Biden and he’s constantly attacking those who try to support your reelection, Mr. President, for four more years. In addition, former President Juan Manuel Santos [inaudible 00:54:51]. In the so called peace process that was supported by Obama-Biden administration, is calling for the demonstrations and unrest to weaken President Tuke’s government. Santos has a US Visa. He lives here. Now for the business matter at hand, I have… Many others have Visas here but should not be here, but anyway, now the business matter at hand.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-latinos-for-trump-roundtable-event-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump ‘Latinos for Trump’ Roundtable Event Transcript September 25","54:03"

I was assisted by the PPP program, not only to save my job, but many others in our community. I have a not-for-profit organization, America’s Business Network, that we were able to assist 107 companies and many more people received that assistance, Mr. President. When they knew I was coming for this meeting, they wanted to say thank you, and I’m the voice for them to say thank you because you really are surviving small businesses in our community and thank you very much.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-latinos-for-trump-roundtable-event-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump ‘Latinos for Trump’ Roundtable Event Transcript September 25","55:23"
"Fabio Andretti","Talking about latino interpretation, Hispanic interpretation, there’s two men in this forum that have acquired a home-based airline that filed for chapter 7, Miami Air, that services is the Department of Defense and have laid off 350 people here in Miami. We’re working in due diligence with the Department of Transportation, with the FAA, and the Treasury to get the 350 employees back to work. We already hired 30, our first plane come in at the end of this month and six more to come very quickly after that. Mr. President, the airline CARES Act as an aviation person is key to the industry, but it’s key here in South Florida for Miami to bring those employees back to work and continue to serve as the Department of Defense.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-latinos-for-trump-roundtable-event-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump ‘Latinos for Trump’ Roundtable Event Transcript September 25","56:11"

To count the estimated 1 million Colombians in Florida, of which, Mr. President, 50% are US citizens in an issue based borders who do not want the leftist socialist government in the United States. Our business people that are here with us today also are very grateful and very optimistic, Mr. President, with the reassuring program in the Americas Crisis program to support the companies here in Florida as well and our allies like Panama and Colombia. It’s an excellent program and let me congratulate you sir. We are looking forward to see implementation and partner up to assist those projects of the reassuring program.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-latinos-for-trump-roundtable-event-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump ‘Latinos for Trump’ Roundtable Event Transcript September 25","56:58"

This is a hat made by Colombian artisans. As you see, it’s Trump 2020. This is a symbol out there that we’re working for you in the campaign in getting you reelected. This is made by hand.

"Donald Trump","So four years ago, we were elected. I didn’t think it was a surprise because I saw the crowds. I saw the spirit. We had tremendous spirit, incredible spirit, actually. And it was something special. That was the most exciting night, that beautiful November evening, right? And I actually think now, and I used to say, “Well, that was really important,” but this one’s going to be equal. It’s really not. This is going to be a more important election. And I think it’s going to be an even bigger victory. And when we’re talking about bringing the country together and we were doing that because people were calling, we were so successful. I mean, even now you have all these records for Hispanic Americans, Latinos, all records.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-latinos-for-trump-roundtable-event-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump ‘Latinos for Trump’ Roundtable Event Transcript September 25","58:36"
"Donald Trump","We have tremendous records, but just before the plague came in from China, they should have stopped it. They should have stopped it, but just before it came in, people were calling me. Democrats were calling. They wanted to get together. It was happening because we had the best job numbers. We had the best businesses. We had the best everything. We’ve rebuilt our military. By the way, our vets are in great shape. Now our vets are fantastic. So we did things that nobody ever thought were possible. And dd it pretty quickly over a period of three years and nobody’s done what we’ve done in three years, three and a half years. But then the plague came in and we had to close it up and we had to rebuild it and we saved millions of lives by closing it, but now we’re rebuilding it. It’s going much faster than before, but I can tell you, it was all coming together.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-latinos-for-trump-roundtable-event-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump ‘Latinos for Trump’ Roundtable Event Transcript September 25","59:43"

And now it’s happening again. And that’s exactly what we’re doing, but I just want to thank this community. I want to thank so many of the champions. You have some great, great people out in the audience, friends of mine, a lot of friends of mine. And somebody I have great respect for, because I respect when somebody is the best at what they do.

But thank you for being here Jorge. You’re really a great champ. You’re great at what you do and it’s right up here too. Don’t let anyone ever think it isn’t. But I want to thank everybody for being here, and Max, thank you very much. Great job you’ve done. Great job. We will go on. We’re going to win. We’re going to have four great years. I think it’s going to be. I think next year is going to be one of the best years we’ve ever had. And I will never forget our Hispanic American community. It’s just been with me even even four years ago it was. We did very well and with the Cubans, we were in 90%. I don’t know, is it possible to be at 100%? But we’ve always done well, but now it’s really reached a new level. I will never forget you. And I want to thank you all for being here. Thank you all very much. Thank you.
