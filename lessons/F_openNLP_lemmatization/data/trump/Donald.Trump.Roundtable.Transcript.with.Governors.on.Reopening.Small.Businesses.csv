"Donald Trump","Governor Pete Ricketts of Nebraska. Pete, thank you very much. And a man that I’m going to see a little bit over the weekend, and this was really by coincidence that you happen to be here today because it was for a different reason. It has to do with small business, Governor Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma. We’re going to be in Oklahoma and it’s a crowd like I guess nobody’s seen before. We have a tremendous, tremendous request for tickets. I think probably has never happened politically before. One of the reasons we chose your state as you know, Kevin was that you’ve done so, so well with the COVID. You’ve handled it incredibly well. We appreciate… You both have actually. You both have, so congratulations. Along with several extraordinary small business owners from their state. Also with us, our Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and small business administrator Jovita.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","00:00"
"Donald Trump","Thank you Jovita. Very good. Small business is no longer small businesses, it’s big business. It’s one of the biggest businesses. As a result of the virus 22% of small businesses were forced to close earlier this year, including 41% of black owned businesses. But under my administration strategy to vanquish the virus and restart our economy, small businesses across the nation are now safely reopening. All over the nation they’re reopening at levels like nobody’s seen before. We’re sheltering individuals at the highest risk. If you look at really high risk individuals, we are really watching them and we’re taking care of them and we know what the high risk means, but largely it means older people, especially older people, senior citizens that have a tremendous… They have a problem. If they have a heart problem, if they have diabetes, if they have any kind of a problem, they’re much more susceptible. We’re all watching that very closely. We’ve learned a lot over the last number of months. In the past four months, we’ve conducted over 25 million coronavirus tests and distributed over 1.5 billion pieces of personal protective equipment. America’s better supplied and more prepared to reenter then I would say just about any other place. You look at what we’ve done with ventilators. We’re now making thousands a week of ventilators, very big, expensive, complex equipment, and we’re sending them to other countries and we’re all stocked up. Our country is totally stocked up. Everybody has their ventilators at maximum they can use, but we are sending them to other countries. The nice part, and I say it a lot because I think it’s pretty amazing, when we came here you had very few ventilators in this country. By the time we started not one person that needed a ventilator, didn’t get it. Everybody that needed a ventilator got a ventilator. There wasn’t one instance anywhere in our country. We stocked up those shelves. The cupboard was empty and we filled up the cupboards.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","00:57"
"Donald Trump","In the past four months tremendous things have happened, but I think probably the biggest thing of all is the knowledge that we’ve gained of this disease, of this plague, of this virus. Call it what you want. To help small businesses survive the shutdown I approved over $670 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program. And Steve that’s been a tremendous success. And we’re talking with Democrats about doing something further now, but the numbers, the way they’re coming in, it’s been really incredible. So we’re able to spot it, but we’re here to help businesses and to help people. To date we’ve processed over 4.6 million small business loans saving and supporting an estimated 50 million American jobs.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","03:08"
"Donald Trump","Jovita, that’s incredible. The small business owners that we have with us this afternoon all received the PPP loans and now their businesses are under the road to recovery and they’re doing really well. We have a lot of businesses that are doing really well. We’re talking about a V-shape, we’re almost like an eye shape, I is straight up and down, but I talked about V-shape and a lot of people disagreed with me, not everybody, but a lot of very smart Wall Streeters were disagreeing. Now they’re pretty much coming on board saying it looks like it could be a V. So, a V is the thing we were shooting for and it looks like that’s what we’ve got.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","03:56"
"Donald Trump","I want to thank our people and my representatives for their decisive actions. Last month we added a record 2.5 million jobs. It’s the highest in the history of our country in one month. That’s the highest number of jobs. 2.5 million, the Dow rose above 26,000 points. We saw the largest surge in retail sales ever recorded. Next year is shaping up to be one of the greatest years in the history of our country from an economic standpoint. I truly believe that. I think we’re going to have a great third quarter. We’re going to have a great fourth quarter. And next year is going to be a phenomenal year. I believe that NASDAQ actually set the record during a pandemic. NASDAQ just said they broke their record. Larry, is that a correct statement? So it was higher than even before. it’s an amazing achievement.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","04:31"
"Donald Trump","After I was elected president our country added more than seven million jobs, 12,000 factories and trillions of dollars of wealth. We created nearly 9,000 opportunity zones and African American, Asian American and Hispanic American unemployment, and poverty reached all time lows. We had the greatest employment numbers we’ve ever had. Then we had to turn it off. We saved millions of people by doing it. We did the right thing and now we’re turning it back on and the numbers are going up much, much faster than anybody would have thought. It’s a great honor to see it. And these two governors, by the way have done a fantastic job. Two very extraordinary men, Nebraska and Oklahoma.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","05:24"
"Donald Trump","We built the strongest economy the world has ever seen before the virus and together we’re doing it again. So we did it before the virus. We had to turn it off and now we’re doing it again and that’s what’s happening. So now I’d like to maybe we’ll start off with Governor Ricketts and then we’ll get to my friend over here. I’ll be seeing so much of you in the next couple of days. I’ll take you a second. Thank you very much, please.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","06:09"
"Pete Ricketts","Well, thank you very much, Mr. President, and to all of your team here. We really appreciate your effort, your leadership, and that of your teams’ to be able to help us through this pandemic and really give us the tools to be able to manage it. The PPE program you mentioned has been tremendously successful in Nebraska. Because of the great relationships our community bankers have with our small businesses, we were able to take advantage of that and really cover over 80% of our payroll. It really was a fantastic way to be able to keep people working. We had the third lowest unemployment rate in April, and we want to keep people in their jobs. We really appreciate all the work you’re doing. You may recall, we were one of the few states that didn’t issue a stay at home order or shelter in place order.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","06:34"
"Pete Ricketts","What we did is try to take common sense steps, and ask people to take responsibility, to be able to follow the directives that you all were putting out with regard to avoiding large groups, washing their hands, that sort of thing and making sure they keep six feet and distance in public, that sort of thing. And by doing that and targeting specific higher risk businesses that we asked to shut down for a shorter period of time, we were able to be able to stem the tide of the virus. We’ve actually got the lowest hospitalizations in our state right now we had since the end of April. It’s got a nice bell shaped curve. It went up and now it’s coming back down. Our cases are steady and flat, and now we’re just really in the mode of managing this. You put the 25 person rule in-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","07:17"

You put the 25 person rule in place in mid-March and that bought us the time to be able to strengthen our contact tracing-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","08:03"

"Pete Ricketts","… our testing, our PPE, our quarantine space, put plans in place to help at risk populations and put our rules in place. And that’s what gave us the opportunity to be able to manage it. So we really appreciate all that you’ve done Mr. President. Thank you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","08:08"

"Pete Ricketts","We’re still actually recovering from the floods from last year, so we’ve got the double whammy. Agriculture in particular has really taken a heavy hit between what happened then, last year with the flooding and then to the pandemic this year. But again, your administration has been helpful. The phase one China deal for example-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","08:27"

"Pete Ricketts","They are, they are and that helps. That makes such a difference. Mr. President, I can’t tell you. When people aren’t driving, they’re not using ethanol. Right? Because that gets blended into our fuel supply. When our food processing facilities are impacted by coronavirus and they’re slowing down, our ranchers don’t have a place to take their animals. So there’s a lot of impact to agriculture and your administration has been great and working with us to be able to help them through it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","08:49"

"Kevin Stitt","Well, thank you so much for having us, Mr. President. And on behalf of Oklahoma, we’re so excited to have you. And like you said, I don’t know if people caught that, but over a million people have requested tickets to come to this event. So it’s just going to be an amazing, Oklahoma’s ready for your visit. It’s going to be safe and we’re really, really excited.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","09:17"
"Kevin Stitt","But during this whole a COVID crisis, as we’ve been fighting it, your administration has been having calls twice a week. The Vice President have been so helpful to myself and all the other governors, listening to what our needs were and providing everything we need. So it’s just been going great.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","09:37"
"Kevin Stitt","And so we’re one of the first states that has safely and measurably reopened. We we went to phase three on June 1st. So we’re 56 days into our reopening plan. And currently we have under 200 people in the hospital across the state of Oklahoma. And we had an uptick in the number of cases and so the media tries to talk about that. But we knew we were going to have an increased a little bit because we’re 56 days into reopening.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","09:54"
"Kevin Stitt","But what’s interesting it’s the 18 to 35 group that we’ve seen a slight increase, but they’re the asymptomatic. And we’re testing so many more people right now than we were initially and the positive cases are still 3.8%. So we’ve seen this steady decline in the hospitalizations and we have to learn. I tell Oklahomans that COVID is in the US, it’s in Oklahoma, we have to learn how to be safe and how to have to move on.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","10:25"
"Kevin Stitt","And so we were able to build capacity because the whole reason I issued 25 executive orders in Oklahoma was to build capacity in our hospitals and also the PPE. And we were able to do that and really flatten that curve, and that was our objective. And I told Oklahoma and stuff the better they do in that period of time, the quicker we can start reopening.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","10:51"

I traveled to North Carolina as well as Dallas and visit with the face base and the lending community, as well as some small businesses. To feel and see, and as evidence of how PPP is actually working. Not only in the faith based, not only in the small businesses, but also the lending community.

We’ve asked the lenders, the very diverse lenders that we’ve signed up over 5,400 of them, to provide outreach, very aggressive outreach to our inner cities and underserved communities. I’ve spoken with some of the governors, I’ve spoken with the mayors as well, that we need to do more. There’s over a $100,000,000,000 dollars available remaining in the PPP program, a very successful program.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","12:05"

The PPP has been a tremendous success, we’ve seen that in the employment numbers. We still have more work to do. We want to make sure that every single person who lost their job because of COVID gets back to work, and we won’t be done until that happens. And I’m also pleased that this week working with the Federal Reserve, we’ve opened the Main Street Funding Facility. Again, that will be accessible to small businesses down to $250,000 loans.

And I think the numbers you laid out are worth reemphasizing because it’s exactly that 2.5 million jobs added blowing past expectations. You had the experts off by about 10 million jobs. That’s quite an extraordinary number to be off by. Also the DAO, above 26,000 points. You mentioned the NASDAQ setting the record. Seven million jobs, 9,000 opportunity zones. You’re the jobs’ president. You did this once. You brought seven million jobs and quite clearly what the markets are saying is they have faith that you are the jobs’ president that will do this again.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","16:32"

We were really focused on three things in terms of making sure that our economy stayed on track and first it was stabilization. So the PPP, the [inaudible 00:17:40] loan gave us the liquidity injection that we needed to help us out. Debt servicing our community banks work very closely with the small businesses to defer payments, and then we move into recovery. And when we talk about recovery, the $1.08 billion that we’ve received from the Treasury has been a huge help. We’ve broken it down into four programs, small business stabilization, rural broadband, we’ve given a million dollars for Gallup and then we also looking at taking workers that are in industries that are shrinking and retraining them in high demand industries so we can put Nebraskans back to work in the right areas.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","17:27"

"Melissa Hegarty","Good afternoon Mr. President, governors, secretaries, directors, and honored guests. My name is Melissa Hegarty and I am proud and honored to be the invited guest of Governor Ricketts from the great state of Nebraska. I am a wife and mother to two young daughters ages nine and 11, as well as the co-owner of four bakeries in Nebraska and Iowa. We’ve been in business for 10 years and have approximately 92 employees. Early on in COVID-19, we decided not to lay off any employees rather ask the ones that live at home with their parents to scale back on some of their hours if they can. By doing that, it would give the other employees that needed their shifts to be able to cover their rent and other expenses and opportunity to keep their hours. Most of our employees are in their early twenties with no families to fall back on so it was critical for us to take care of them any way we could.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","18:38"
"Melissa Hegarty","It was an important decision for the federal government to allow each state’s governor to decide how to formulate their own plan of how to close and in turn reopen their state. Fortunately, my businesses in both Nebraska and Iowa were able to continue to serve our guests inside the bakery while practicing social distancing, sanitizing between guests, all while everyone wears a mask. We had several terrible weeks of sales leading into Easter. It was easily the scariest time of my life as a business owner, not knowing what would happen next. We did apply for and receive Paycheck Protection Program funds through our small locally-owned bank, who we’ve had a strong relationship with since we started back in 2010. That program has been helpful for us to continue to meet our fiduciary obligations, in terms of promises to our staff as well as paying our monthly bills.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","19:31"
"Melissa Hegarty","As the virus continued past Easter, we were able to increase our delivery business while adding a new service for our guests, curbside pickup. But with curbside pickup, it did come with some challenges. So increased labor would be probably the biggest effect on our bottom-line. Additional employees have been added to answer the phones and runners are needed to take orders out to the guests waiting in their car. By mid May, sales were picking up and we did have our best Mother’s Day ever seeing double digit growth over last year’s weekly sales. So my Nebraska bakeries have now entered phase three starting this upcoming Monday of Governor Rickett’s directed health measures. We anticipate our guests desire to celebrate all of the life’s events they missed over the past three months. New babies, birthdays, anniversaries, retirements with our ultimate hope that it will transfer into a much busier summer than we normally would have. I want to thank you for inviting me to be a part of this important discussion. I’m honored.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","20:22"

"Woman","Thank you Mr. President. I’m honored to be here representing small independent restaurant industry and the great state of Oklahoma. Thank you for inviting me. I am a small independent restaurant owner. I own and operate Stella Modern Italian Cuisine in Oklahoma City. My restaurant celebrated 10 years in business in April. Prior to COVID-19, I employed 30 people in the restaurant. When restaurants were closed for inside dining, I was forced to furlough some very dedicated and loyal employees for the first time ever. Since I did receive the PPP financial assistance, I was able to offer all of our staff their jobs back and all but three returned. I want to thank you and Governor Stitt for working so hard for our economy and helping us reopen in a responsible and systematic way. Our industry have worked very closely with Governor Stitt and the Health Department of Oklahoma on guidelines to reopen with a phased approach.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","21:34"
"Woman","It has been good to get back to work and to be able to serve our guests. Under the guidelines that we adopted in Oklahoma, we are using data-driven points to ensure we are reopening our restaurants and economy in a safe and in an efficient manner. In reopening our number one goal has been to keep our customers safe as well as our employees. We know there’s work to be done, to create a sense of confidence in our diners as well as our employees, and help people feel good about dining out again. We are diligently following all the guidelines on using PPP, I’m sorry, PPE for our employees, doubling our sanitation practice, and encouraging our customers to follow the suggested guidelines for social distancing. Restaurants have always had outstanding protocol in place for safely preparing food and serving our customers in a safe manner. As you’re aware, the restaurant industry has suffered greatly during this and unprecedented time. Our job loss and lost sales has been overwhelming. So I want to thank you for working so hard for our economy and signing into-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","22:41"

There is more that needs to be done and we appreciate the opportunity we have to work closely with you, your administration, and our congressional leaders for next steps to get our economy and our industry back to work and fully open. President Trump, America’s restaurant industry is grateful for your leadership in guiding us through this pandemic. Thank you again for inviting me to meet with you and thank you for Governor Stitt, for your leadership in getting Oklahomans back to work.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","24:03"

"Pete Patel","Thank you, Mr. President. Honored to represent the lodging industry before America’s first hotelier President, grateful to Governor Stitt for his leadership and for the invitation to join today. My name is Pete Patel, first generation American. My family and I immigrated to the United States in 1979 in search of the American dream. We found that American dream in Tulsa, Oklahoma as small business and hoteliers. Our company owns and operates 12 hotels in Eastern Oklahoma. The current crisis, lodging was the first to suffer because of shelter in place and we will be the last to recover. It may take up to two years. Before COVID, our industry had record occupancies, profitability and new development hotels, thanks to the exceptional strong economy under your leadership, Mr. President. Because of COVID, occupancy dropped to 20% nationally, revenues fell by 50% and 70% of all hotel employees were either laid off are furloughed. For the first time in my career, we were forced to lay off employees and that was the most gut wrenching experience that we’ve had.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","25:05"
"Pete Patel","The Payroll Protection Program was a lifeline to our industry to help America’s small businesses and our employees. The best thing for our business is that our economy opens. Grateful to Oklahoma Governor for his systematic, data-driven approach to leading our state back to opening. Currently our occupancies have picked up a bit, but we still have a long ways to go as an industry as well as our market. The hospitality industry as a whole, as stated, are reopening hotels in a safe and healthy manner. The industry has implemented what’s called Safe Stay Standard, sanitization, PPE use, social distancing, things like limiting buffets and using grab and go pre-packaged items. Swimming pools and gyms are limited with appointments for use. Guests and employees are only safe as how we make the properties and the hotel industry has done a great job in adapting ways to make sure all of our employees and guests are safe.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","26:21"
"Pete Patel","Mr. President, I would like to mention a couple of things. We need more states to reopen, consumers to feel safe to travel. Industry will need additional resources to help pay our bills. Increase cap on the [inaudible 00:27:58] program would be very helpful to us and we need pressure relief from our local banks who may be stressed in these times coming up, that have hospitality loans. We will need help from the Federal Reserve and FDIC on those two things. In conclusion, Mr. President, America’s hoteliers are grateful for your leadership. We appreciate, and you know what it’s like to own and operate hotels. We are looking forward to working with you towards a swift and strong recovery. Thank you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","27:41"
"Donald Trump","I’m impressed by your 20% number. If that was your low point, you’re better than any hotel company that I’ve seen. We had Hilton and they were at 1%, right? And we had all of the big ones and they were from one to four or 5%. So if you’re at 20%, congratulations, that’s pretty good.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-roundtable-transcript-with-governors-on-reopening-small-businesses-june-18","Donald Trump Roundtable Transcript with Governors on Reopening Small Businesses","28:35"

"Brooke Rollins","Mr. President, thank you. As your Domestic Policy Chief, what an honor it is to have all of these small business owners here at the White House. I’m reminded that just yesterday, Mr. President, we had veterans in, the day before we were doing policing reform in the Rose Garden, the day before that we were talking about seniors and taking care of our elderly and fraud. Everything you do, every day, every minute, is how to do the most for all Americans and the small business, this is the backbone of our country.
