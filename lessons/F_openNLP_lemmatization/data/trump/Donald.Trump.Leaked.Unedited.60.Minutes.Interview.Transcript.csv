"Donald Trump","Well, I’m going to say that. And the other side was starting to call, let’s get together. There was going to be unity. And then we got hit with the plague and we had to do it again.

"Donald Trump","No, what I’m saying to you, Lesley, is the following. We do more testing than any country in the world by far. Second is India with 1.5 billion people. We do more testing. If we did half the testing, we’d have half the cases. If we did no testing, like many countries, we would have very few cases. Because we do so much testing, the fake news media loves to say cases are up.

"Donald Trump","Yes, cases are up because we are doing tremendous testing and we’re finding where there’s a problem.

"Donald Trump","We have turned the corner. We understand the disease. We understand the elderly and we’re taking care of them at a level like nobody’s ever taken care of the elderly, especially the elderly with diabetes problems, heart problems. We are taking care of them like nobody’s ever taken care of them. We also understand youth, 99.9%. As an example, Barron had it and it was gone in no time. It was just like he had it, it was gone, hardly knew he even had it. So we are taking care of our people, but we’ve done a great job with the ventilators, with the equipment, with stocking governors that were not stocked.

"Donald Trump","Oh, I didn’t say that. You know, that’s so misleading, the way … I say jokingly suburban women, you should love me because I’m giving you security and I got rid of the worst regulation. See, the way you said that is why people think of you and everyone else as fake news. I said kiddingly, suburban women, you should love me. I got rid of a regulation that would bring low income housing into suburbia that would destroy suburbia. And I said that in a joking way. The way you have it, it’s like I’m begging. I’m kidding.

"Donald Trump","I’m saving suburbia. He’s going to destroy suburbia. He’s got a regulation, which I terminated, that he would put back and even worse that will destroy, that will bring low income housing projects into suburbia. And women understand that. And they’ve really learned about it over the last two, three weeks. I terminated the worst regulation you could possibly have. It’s gone, and suburban women appreciate it. They want security. They want safety. Look, I’ve been endorsed by almost every police department, almost every law enforcement group in the country. He’s been endorsed by almost nobody.

Plus I closed it very early from China, heavily infected, and even from Europe heavily infected, we’ve done a good job. We’ve done maybe a great job.
