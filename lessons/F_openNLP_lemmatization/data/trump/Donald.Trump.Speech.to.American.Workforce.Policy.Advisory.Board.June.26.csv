"Donald Trump","We’re making a lot of progress with the whole situation that came in from a place called China as you probably know, you probably see, but we have a little work to do and we’ll get it done. We’re having some very good numbers coming out in terms of the comeback, the comeback of our nation and I think it’s going very rapidly and it’s going to be very good but right now we’re in that process of building and it’s an honor that you’re with us today, we very much appreciate it. I’m delighted to welcome members of the Workforce Policy Advisory Board and I want to thank Ivanka she works very hard on this Board. She works very hard to get jobs and it’s made in the USA and jobs in the USA. I saw a group of your people yesterday having to do with ships, you’re involved in that partnership and it’s fantastic what they’re doing in Wisconsin. It was really a great day.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-to-american-workforce-policy-advisory-board-june-26","Donald Trump Speech to American Workforce Policy Advisory Board June 26","00:01"
"Donald Trump","The Secretary of Treasury is with us and he’s worked very hard and I think he’s got some very good things to say and some pretty big news and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Secretary of Labor Gene Scalia, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and Small Business Administrator who has definitely kept busy, Jovita, where’s Jovita? Jovita? Good. Jovita Carranza. Thanks also to Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds who has done terrifically. Kim? Hi Kim, nice to see you. Thank you very much and Eric Holcomb, governor of Indiana and we always recognize Eric because he’s … How tall are you Eric? [inaudible 00:01:45] pretty tall guy, right? But we have one that’s a little taller. You know where that is, Alaska? You know that, right? You’re doing a great job, we appreciate it as well as the CEOs who have signed our pledge to American workers, Marillyn Hewson, thank you very much of Lockheed-Martin. Sebastian Thrun of Udacity and Ginni Rometty of IBM. I want to thank you all, you’ve been really here from the beginning. Very much from the beginning and we appreciate it very much.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-to-american-workforce-policy-advisory-board-june-26","Donald Trump Speech to American Workforce Policy Advisory Board June 26","01:00"
"Donald Trump","Together we built the greatest economy in history and literally in the history of the world, the greatest we’ve ever had, the greatest the world has ever seen and now we have to bring it back because we had a close in order to save millions of lives. We added 2.5 million jobs last month which was incredible number, the largest monthly increase in history and more than double the previous record, so we’re bringing it back. We had the greatest ever and we had to close it and now we bring it back and we start off with 2.5 million jobs in one month. I would say that’s pretty good Marillyn, right? That’s the highest ever done and then likewise retail sales surge by nearly 18% last month. That was the biggest jump ever recorded, so that’s great. The stock market has seen you go back a week, one week. So the best 50 days in its history, best 50 day increase in the history of the stock markets. Our pledge to America’s workers has secured commitments to over 16 million job and training opportunities from employers nationwide and some of the employers are with us and they’ve been fantastic.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-to-american-workforce-policy-advisory-board-june-26","Donald Trump Speech to American Workforce Policy Advisory Board June 26","02:18"
"Donald Trump","I want to thank the American people for doing such an incredible job. They understand what’s happening and they see how fast we’re turning it around. I want to just state that this is Americans of all backgrounds that we’re talking about, to have the chance we want to get them the chance to learn and to build a successful career. We want to train Americans and we want to hire Americans so we’re training American and we’re hiring American. Before the pledge and this is a very big factor, we have a problem that has about 22 different names, but I’ll just call it the plague but before the plague struck, we had the lowest African-American and Hispanic-American, Asian-American unemployment ever. We’ve had the most jobs we’ve ever had, almost 160 million jobs. We’ve never been in a position like that. Women were thriving. Best numbers ever and since my election, more than half of those jobs, more than half, first time that’s ever happened went to women but now we want to get that all back, the African-American group got hit very hard. The Hispanic-American group got hit very hard. Essentially all groups got hit hard but now it’s all coming back.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-to-american-workforce-policy-advisory-board-june-26","Donald Trump Speech to American Workforce Policy Advisory Board June 26","03:32"
"Donald Trump","To further expand opportunity I’m taking a bold action to reform the federal workforce today. I’ll sign an executive order that directs the federal government to replace outdated and really outdated … It’s called degree-based hiring with skill-based hiring so we want it based on skill. The federal government will no longer be narrowly focused on where you went to school but the skills and the talents that you bring to the job. We want that skill to be there, we want it based on merit, we’ve looked at merit for a long time and we’ve been able to get that done and today’s signing is a very, very important one. I think maybe before I sign I’ll ask Ivanka to say a few words and then we’ll go around a little bit. We’ll pick a few people and then we’ll sign and we go back to work. Thank you very much, Ivanka.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-to-american-workforce-policy-advisory-board-june-26","Donald Trump Speech to American Workforce Policy Advisory Board June 26","04:54"
"Ivanka Trump","Thank you Mr. President and it’s an honor to have you here. We just convened our sixth meeting of our Workforce Advisory Board and we got an update on the team’s response on your bold call to action. First we’re going to be launching and Ginni Rometty in partnership with Tim Cook spearheaded this group, a massive advertising campaign that directs those that need to re-skill, learn a new trade to secure a job to the resources to enable them to do that so we’re very excited about the launch of this private sector led and driven campaign to match Americans with the training they need and ultimately the job they can seize that exists. The Advisory Board is also creating a series of pilot programs and Scott Pulsipher and Doug McMillon had been running these groups where we really think about how we create the resumes of the future and allow people to find job vacancies based on skill and for employers to connect with those unemployed workers again based on skill so creating a lot more efficiency to that process.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-to-american-workforce-policy-advisory-board-june-26","Donald Trump Speech to American Workforce Policy Advisory Board June 26","05:47"
"Ivanka Trump","You are once again leading by example here today with this EO signing. As the nation’s largest employer, we are always seeking to recruit and retain the best and the brightest to serve the American people. Last December you fought for and secured paid leave for every federal worker, this was a first, creating a workplace that reflects our American values of both work and family and helping us retain our amazing talent. It’s also why you fought so hard this spring when COVID struck to secure paid sick leave for Americans employed by small businesses and additional funding for child care providers helping millions and millions of Americans remain employed and providing relief to small businesses across the country. This is going to ensure a faster and stronger recovery.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-to-american-workforce-policy-advisory-board-june-26","Donald Trump Speech to American Workforce Policy Advisory Board June 26","06:51"
"Ivanka Trump","Today, we’re taking that next step as you mentioned and signing an executive order that directs federal agencies to hire based on skills and knowledge, not just outdated degree requirements. This will allow us to better recognize the talents and competencies of all Americans we hire. You built once the most inclusive economy in this country’s history and you’ll build it again. Through our pledge to America’s workers, the private sector has committed to investing in the training and education of over 16 million American students and workers and this continues, despite the vast change that the plague ushered in. Companies like Udacity, Sebastian Thrun joins us today, had been leading the way, and they’d been using their pledge commitment and fulfilling it by providing free tech training to American workers laid off as a result of COVID.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-to-american-workforce-policy-advisory-board-june-26","Donald Trump Speech to American Workforce Policy Advisory Board June 26","07:40"
"Ivanka Trump","I recently had the opportunity to virtually meet one of the students that went through your program and received your scholarship in conjunction with the pledge and it was incredible. His name was Tony, he was a lifelong truck driver, he owned his own business, it was a single rig that he had. Through a series of setbacks, the company ended up going under. He signed up for a course in tech and is now a software engineer providing for his family, absolutely loving what he does, and there are many, many stories like Tony that hopefully will inspire millions across the nation. Marillyn Hewson, also an early pledge signed, of Lockheed-Martin committed to hiring during the pandemic using virtual technologies and other techniques to ensure recruitment processes move forward. So with more people teleworking and learning from home than ever before, we have a lot to accomplish in the months ahead and I’m really excited about your effort to extend this working group and to reform our federal hiring practices as we think about building that inclusive American economy as we transition to greatness. So thank you for today and it’s a pleasure to have you join us.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-to-american-workforce-policy-advisory-board-june-26","Donald Trump Speech to American Workforce Policy Advisory Board June 26","08:31"

It’s really an honor to serve on this policy board and I must say I agree with you [inaudible 00:09:57] Trump, Ivanka Trump and Secretary Ross have led us well. We had a great effort over the last several meetings and put forward some strong recommendations that I hope to match the skills together with the jobs that are there and at Lockheed-Martin we’re proud that this year we’re on a path to hire 12,000 people and a lot of it is around making sure that we are getting the kind of apprenticeships and scholarships and skills training for them so that they can link up to jobs in our operation.

It’s our chance to really redefine how education looks like and move into a world where people learn lifelong, have lifelong access and can really unfold their livelihoods. Ivanka was of course the visionary behind all this and thank you for doing this. Mentioned Tony [Boswell 00:11:10], a truck driver who was driving trucks for 10 years and then his truck broke down and it he couldn’t finance the new engine that he needed and he was unemployed, had no income, no education and came across by randomness a Google scholarship that Udacity launched, and then in ten months’ time was really able to become a software engineer.

So my hat is off and thanks to Secretary Ross and to Ivanka for having led us through this and I think we have put on the table is substantive change and I know it is change to a company like mine. So as you signed Skills First, we’ve adopted that and 15% of our hires last year were people from non-traditional backgrounds and so it’s really what this is all about I think and giving everyone a bright future in the digital era so thank you for that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-to-american-workforce-policy-advisory-board-june-26","Donald Trump Speech to American Workforce Policy Advisory Board June 26","11:50"

I appreciate how … With the leadership of Ivanka and Secretary Ross, we really have identified the various elements, connected those elements whether it’s been consistent data, definition, goals and messaging, and I look forward to really amplifying that in the state of Iowa. By executive order I just created an economic taskforce. I brought several CEOs, business leaders and non-profits together to utilize their expertise in the way through innovation, adaptation and creativity, adjusted within weeks to the coronavirus and everything that this group has talked about will fold so well into what we’re trying to do at the state level and when you think about that happening in every state across the country, we really are going to come back stronger and better and really help provide opportunities for every single American so thank you for leading it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-to-american-workforce-policy-advisory-board-june-26","Donald Trump Speech to American Workforce Policy Advisory Board June 26","13:43"

Private sector re-skilling and retraining and not only will people come back to the labor force when they’re re-skilled, they’ll come back with higher wages and they’ll come back with more confidence and it will make a huge difference as it already has and so I have added you to the four pillars of growth, the president.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-to-american-workforce-policy-advisory-board-june-26","Donald Trump Speech to American Workforce Policy Advisory Board June 26","15:40"

"Wilbur Ross","Yes Mr. President. Thank you for the opportunity to help, Ivanka and the others on this group. I’ve been very, very impressed with the productivity of this advisory board. Most advisory boards create a big thick book at the end that goes in the library and nothing happens. This group, every single meeting there’s a specific tangible thing that gets followed up and it gets implemented so it’s really been a heartwarming thing to see how productive these folks have been and I congratulate all of them.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-to-american-workforce-policy-advisory-board-june-26","Donald Trump Speech to American Workforce Policy Advisory Board June 26","16:45"

Back in the summer of 2016, the Congressional Budget Office said that we’d be at 5% unemployment in February. They said that between and February 2020 they said we’d create 1.9 million jobs, we created seven million jobs. Larry touched on it, it was policies of tax cuts, of deregulation which brought us there which was just a wonderful thing for the American worker as jobs were being created and wages were rising but there was other work going on. What you see today is a manifestation of other things that were being done that are now going to have their day to really help workers. We are coming back. Larry’s mentioned some of the numbers, but we know that training will be important and we’re fortunate that this really very extraordinary group and as Secretary Ross has said, a group that really generated valuable product, they were working quietly to help train American workers. I spoke earlier about a new apprenticeship rule that we adopted in the Labor Department that I think will be very helpful.

It’s not just the work of this council and the leadership of Ivanka, it is the executive order that you are about to sign that completely resets the playing field. The federal government is the largest employer in the country with two million employees. Two-thirds of American adults do not have a college degree. Your signature that is recalibrating the work force away from being degree only to skill set is transformational and the opportunity for you to fight for all Americans, I think about Tony that Ivanka talked about, that Sebastian talked about from Udacity, from a truck driver to a software engineer, next potentially into the federal government because of this executive order that is focusing on skills rather than degrees.

I started as a box handler in the world’s largest logistics company and so when I hear everyone talk about the dedication of the workforce and establishing some really comprehensive training, I took advantage of every training opportunity there was in that private sector and perhaps you’ll see another administrator similar to me based on the programs that you’re going to advocate and support. Because of the public-private partnerships that this administration has enabled, the paycheck protection program, just one example that has to four to five small businesses sustain their viability and also protected their employees, a baseline of about 60 million employees.

"Scott Pulsipher","I was just going to say thank you Mr. President. From a university’s perspective, it’s often perceived as skills versus degrees but in reality in a skills denominated future it is that tide that lifts all boats because even those who possess degrees, they can better articulate the skills and competencies that they now have for the future of work and the reality is too is that it’s also more fair, it’s more equitable, it’s more prosperous for our workforce because what it really is is it’s now about what you possess and what you can demonstrate, not how you acquired the competency and skill. So it just creates much more of an equitable pathway and WGU is a competency-based education provider, as always been focused on how do you articulate the outcomes of achieving a degree in a skills and competency-based way so it’s much more aligned with the future of work and so it is truly that tide that lifts all boats. This is a huge step in the right direction so thank you very much.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-to-american-workforce-policy-advisory-board-june-26","Donald Trump Speech to American Workforce Policy Advisory Board June 26","22:34"
