"Donald Trump","Well, thank you very much. And I hope Dan is going to be okay. Dan is a great guy. Dan is a great guy.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","00:18"
"Brian Kilmeade","Yeah. Yeah. He’s going through some very important treatment [crosstalk 00:00:29] and I know he’s going to pull through.

"Brian Kilmeade","Absolutely. When you spar for a living in an octagon to relax, you are a tough guy. Meanwhile, let’s talk about you. You finish up in Michigan, a state that you won last time, by just a few thousand votes. Every vote matters. How do you feel today in 2020 on election day, as opposed to 2016?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","00:35"
"Donald Trump","Well, we feel very good. We have crowds that nobody’s ever had before, I can say that. I think you could agree. It’s been incredible.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","00:53"
"Brian Kilmeade","It’s huge.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","01:01"
"Donald Trump","The crowds have been incredible, and nobody’s ever had it before. And so, I think that translates into a lot of votes, and we’re going to see very soon, but we’re getting very good response. We’re getting a very early response to see, and I think we’re doing incredible in Florida. I think we’re doing… And you were just talking about the vote, the African-American vote, et cetera. I think we’re doing really well with African-American vote. I think we’re doing very, very well with the Hispanic vote, and it’s a great run, but it’s been a great three weeks. Incredible three weeks. I think since the debate [crosstalk 00:01:39] the second debate was very good, and I was also interviewed by Savannah Guthrie. And that was, I think, very good. I mean, I wouldn’t say she was exactly nice to me, but a lot of people watched it. A lot of people. It was a special, or I guess they would call it a town hall. It didn’t feel like a town to me, but it was a very good debate or interview, I guess people say.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","01:01"
"Brian Kilmeade","Right.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","02:07"
"Donald Trump","But the second debate in particular, I think was something that worked out very well. And then we did the… We got back, we’re lucky we got it back, because for a period of time we did not think we were going to get these big rallies back. And we got them back and they were amazing. I mean, they were amazing. And you add it all together, and I think we really took off.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","02:07"
"Steve","Well, Mr. President, it is great to have you on the show. I’m sure you only got about 15 minutes worth of sleep last night. So thanks for calling in. Right now, what you [crosstalk 00:02:43]","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","02:32"
"Donald Trump","Well, this has a special show for me. I’ve liked it from day one. We’ve had a great relationship, and then you have a great show. So it’s my honor.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","02:43"
"Steve","Well, thank you very much. And we are honored because you selected our show to be the first TV interview you did as president. So it’s great that you would us today as well. I know that the Trump team has worked the last four years in the RNC to build a network of people, who you registered and who could get out the vote, especially for today. And so it all comes down to that. But for the person who is undecided on this election day morning, and let’s say, they’re trying to decide between you and Joe Biden, but they’ve had a rough year. The pandemic has been tough on everybody. Maybe somebody in their family has lost a job. Maybe they’re worried about their healthcare. What do you say to that person? To say, go give me another four years. Let’s not switch horses right now.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","02:51"
"Donald Trump","Well, it’s become pretty standard. We built the greatest Academy in the world. It was horribly interrupted by something that should’ve never happened. Came in from China, the plague, the plague from China, the horrible situation. And we had to shut it down and we had to learn about it. We had to shut it down and we did the right thing. We saved two million people. We saved a lot of people. The original model was 2.2 million people. And so if you use that model, and you go, that was a main model, you’ve used that model. We saved two million people, and now we’re building it back up again. And we had the best economy. Nobody had ever seen anything like it. And now what happens is we build it up again and we are doing it at a record clip. You saw the 33.1 on Thursday.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","03:43"
"Donald Trump","That’s the biggest number we’ve ever had GDP. And we’re on a shape to build this up to a level that nobody’s ever seen anything like it. I really think that we’re going to end up with an economy that will be better than last year. Last year was at a record. Last year was the best economy we’ve had. So we have a chance to build something that will be fantastic. Now, in addition to that, we are doing very well. And I say rounding the corner. And some people don’t like that phrase, but I use that phrase. We’re coming out with vaccines, the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before. We have many companies. We have the three main companies, but we have many companies coming out with them. They’re going to be activated very quickly, distributed and activated very quickly. And that will be that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","04:37"
"Donald Trump","We will tame originally, but ultimately get rid of the China plague. You see what’s happening in Europe. It’s a terrible thing. It’s a very terrible thing. This is a horrible disease. We have learned about it. It affects the elderly. I tell the story about Barron Trump. He had it for about two seconds. It just went through him and it’s gone. And the immune system on children, that’s why you’ve got to get the children back to work, children back to school. You have to get the people, they have to go to work. We have to open up our States and that’ll happen. I think now politically that will happen, because you have the date, and politically it will happen. I mean, today’s going to be a very interesting day. It will be a day that, I had this once before and it worked out very well. And this day is going to be something that’s going to be very important and very, very special, I think.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","05:32"
"Speaker 1","Well, Mr. President, you’ve got Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. They’re crisscrossing Pennsylvania. They’re going back out there. I don’t know if that means they’re worried. I want to get your take on that. And also, what are your plans today? Because I know you said yesterday, you said, “We’ve got a lot of big surprises today.” What are those surprises?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","06:34"
"Donald Trump","So I’m doing a big series of phone calls and to some really good people. And you’re the first one, by the way, but I’m doing a big series of calls. And in doing the calls, I’m going to be talking to some people that really, that have been very important. Both to me, important, some very important calls and some people that have been very loyal to me over the years. I like those people too. Even if they reach about 15 people, that’s okay with me. And I’m also going to [crosstalk 00:07:21]","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","06:50"

"Donald Trump","Probably go to Virginia. We have a headquarters over there in Virginia, just to say, thank you to all of the people. And that would be probably around 10:30 or so. I noticed that Biden went out and I think he’s campaigning a little, because he’s worried. We’ve seen tremendous swing changes. We’ve seen actually in the last three days, this reminds me, I hope it reminds me of four years ago. Tremendous changes have taken place over the last week. Tremendous.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","07:21"
"Steve","Like what?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","07:48"
"Donald Trump","And what we think we’re winning Texas very big. We think we’re winning Florida very big. We think we’re winning Arizona very big. I think we’re going to do very well in North Carolina. I think we’re going to do very well in Pennsylvania. We think we’re doing very well everywhere. And it’s more than thinking. We’re seeing trends.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","07:49"
"Brian Kilmeade","Right.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","08:11"
"Donald Trump","And so you can tell this isn’t just taking a poll. This is based on trends. And we think we’re doing very well in States. A lot of States, really. A lot of States.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","08:12"
"Brian Kilmeade","I think the country respects somebody that was willing to work to get something. And I think no one doubts your work ethic. What you’ve done is almost impossible. Those five events yesterday, the 14 events in 72 hours, I can’t imagine anyone else doing it, and standing up and then being on for two hours in front of 25,000 people. I don’t think even your biggest attractor would not be in awe of that. But I was shocked to see this quote from Jen O’Malley with the Biden campaign. When she was asked on a conference call about the results tonight, she said, “Under no scenario will Donald Trump be declared a victor on election night, and we think that that’s really fundamental to how we want to approach tomorrow,” meaning today. How do you take-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","08:22"

"Donald Trump","Well, that was a weird quote, I agree with you. That was a very weird quote and I don’t know what she meant, except maybe she’s talking about the very strange decision made by the US Supreme Court that allows extra time and a lot of other things, frankly, but it allows extra time, and it allows for chaos, frankly. And so maybe she’s talking about that. Maybe you can blow out Pennsylvania, so you don’t have to [crosstalk 00:09:34]-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","09:04"

"Steve","It doesn’t intimidate you?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","09:41"
"Donald Trump","No, I think I’ve gotten to a point we don’t get too intimidated. I have no idea who she is. She has something to do with this campaign, I guess. But no, it was a strange quote. It was not a smart quote either, I think","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","09:44"
"Steve","So, Mr. President, the analysis of what they’re talking about, and some of the things you’ve said, they are suggesting that you may declare victory if the early numbers favor you. At what point will you declare victory?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","09:59"
"Donald Trump","When there’s victory, if there’s victory, I think we’ll have victory. I think the polls are suppression balls. And I think we’ll have victory, but only when there’s victory. I mean there’s no reason to play games. And I think we’ll have victory. I look at it as being a very, a very solid chance at winning. I don’t know what the chances are, I don’t know how they rate the chances, but I think we have a very solid chance of winning. And I think a lot of that has to do with the tremendous crowd size for a small event. There was no small event, every place, no matter where we went were-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","10:16"

"Donald Trump","… the largest… Your friend Tucker did something on his last night, I don’t know if you got to see it, but he said he was looking at the internet or whatever, and he’s looking at these massive crowds like he’s never seen before, and in areas that were great areas, frankly, as far as I’m concerned, these are great people. These are like the heart and soul of our country.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","10:58"
"Donald Trump","And so Tucker, he did a piece on it last night on these incredible crowds, these massive crowds. You know, it hasn’t taken place ever in history, in the history of our country, what we’ve done in terms of crowd size and every… I really did six yesterday because the one from the day before went till two in the morning. So then I got up and did one at eight. So if I include the one that lasted until two in the morning, that was six of them.

"Donald Trump","These are really big, where you have 30, 40,000. We had a 51,000 people, and they’re built in largely at airports, always open because of the corona, but they’re built in airports because we have the room.

"Donald Trump","… because to me, that’s like the ultimate poll, that’s better than somebody that said he interviewed 213 people, and then they send you a check for a million dollars, right? We don’t do that. But I think it’s the ultimate poll. And it’s been, honestly it’s been so much fun to me. There’s so much love at those rallies, nobody’s seen anything like it. They even say many of them, “We love you, we love you, we love you.” They’re screaming, “We love you,” and I don’t think it’s ever happened before.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","12:26"

"Donald Trump","Well in the old days, they wouldn’t put sleepy Joe Biden on every time he opened his mouth. They had other networks for that, frankly. And it’s a much different operation. I’m just telling you. It’s much different. And you have great people when you have Sean and you have Laura and you have yourselves, and you have some incredible people. I’m just saying Tucker has been great. I think you really have incredible people, but it’s much different. I could name some of your side players that you’ll interview. You had a period of time. I think you’re still doing it. But you had Democrats on more than you had Republicans. And look, it’s different. I’m not complaining. I’m just telling people it’s one of the biggest differences, this season compared to last. I think this season, we have much more despite that, and this is hard to believe.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","18:14"
"Donald Trump","I think we’ve done actually much better. We obviously ran a good campaign. It was sort of a miracle campaign, but we have a record to go and we’ve done a lot. When you look at the tax cuts and you look at the regulation cuts, biggest in history. You look at all of the things that we’ve done. Space Force. We rebuilt the military. We rebuilt the entire military. It was a mess.

"Donald Trump","We just got a 91% approval rating for the vets. The vets have been really treated badly for a long period of time. And we got accountability done for the vets, which nobody thought could be done. People treat them badly. They get fired. You couldn’t get people out. The vets lived in the hell. They just lived in hell and you couldn’t get them out. So I mean, well, we’ve done so many other things. The wall is going to be completed within a very short period of time. We’re over 410 miles. We’re doing 10 miles a week. And it’s really an incredible… It’s a system exactly like border patrol wanted. It’s been really amazing. And it’s had a big impact, as you see.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","19:32"
"Donald Trump","I mean, you announced we have the best numbers that we’ve ever had on the Southern border. Like right to try. We did right to try. It’s not a smaller thing. It’s a big thing. They’ve been trying to do it for many years. So if you’re terminally ill and we have a great drug at the FDA but it’s not going to be approved for another two years, but you’re terminally ill, we now can get that drug and use it for somebody who’s terminally ill. We worked a system that works out great. You sign a document to take away liability from the companies and from the country itself. And people have right to try. Instead of going all over the world or going home and dying, they can do this. They’ve been trying to do that for 50 years. They were never able to get it worked out. We moved the embassy, and think of it, in Israel. Every president wanted to do that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","20:18"

But I understand why they didn’t because there was tremendous pressure once you got in not to do it from other countries, tremendous pressure like you haven’t seen before. But I did it.

It’s great for the country.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","21:10"
"Steve","Mr. President, one of the things on your stump speech you talk about is Joe Biden is not going to be moderate. If he is moderate, he’s going to have to give into his left flank. I think we have proof of that from a Zoom call that Bernie Sanders did with the squad. Listen to his agenda if Biden is indeed elected, what’s going to happen. Listen.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","21:36"
"Bernie Sanders","You understand that electing Biden is not the end goal. It is the beginning. And I think as the result of the work that all of you have done, Biden’s proposals in this campaign are a lot stronger than they were in the primary, and his proposals are stronger. Do they go as far as we would want? No, they don’t. And we’re not giving up on our agenda. But you know and I know that at the end of the day, the only way that we’re going to provide quality care to every man, woman and child in an affordable way is through Medicare For All. And we ain’t giving up on that struggle. We’re going to introduce Medicare For All. We organize our people to make sure that Biden becomes the most progressive president.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","21:57"

"Donald Trump","Well, I think it’s very disrespectful to Biden, actually. I think it’s a terribly disrespectful phone call to make. If you gave me that, I would have put it up on the board. We’ve been doing that half the last probably 15 rallies. I put up a board and we put up a lot of things. We put up how he said, “Fracking, fracking.” And then he said, “No fracking.” He came out and said, “There will be no fracking.” And then he went out and did the opposite once he reached Pennsylvania and learned it’s a million jobs and it’s tremendous money. And all of a sudden, he changes his mind. He was never hit by the press, was never asked about it. It’s ridiculous. But we put things like that up on the board. Had you had this, whatever it is, Zoom, I would’ve put that up on the board gladly.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","22:45"
"Donald Trump","This shows tremendous disrespect for Biden. It shows exactly what I was saying that he’s not going to be running the group. And that group of people is probably close to impossible to run. I call it the AOC plus three. That’s a tough group to run. And they would take the country into a terrible place. But Joe’s going to have a hard time. He’s not going to be able to handle that. I mean, Joe is having a very hard time. Joe Biden is not prime time. And he never was actually. But he’s not prime time. And he’s put in a very hard position when you see all of the gaps and all of the problems. This is something that he shouldn’t be… When he says he’s a proud Democrat running for the US Senate.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","23:33"
"Donald Trump","And at first I thought he was joking, but he wasn’t joking. He’s done that a number of times. He’s called his location where he was. He’s in Ohio, and he says, “I’m in Iowa.” It’s great to be with the people of Iowa. And they start screaming, “No, no you’re in Ohio.” And that’s happened many, many times. And that’s something you can’t let happen. That will be the end of the speech. There’s nothing you can do to recover. So, it’s a tough thing for him. Frankly, he should not be in this position.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","24:27"

"Steve","He has never taken us up. Mr. President, you were talking, you referred to the expression up on the board a couple of times. We’re in New Jersey looking out at the skyline of Manhattan that you helped build with so many of your Trump Tower skyscrapers and whatnot. I know you have not been in Midtown Manhattan in the last 72 hours, but you would not recognize it because most stores and businesses and apartment buildings and things like that are boarded up on the first level, because they are so afraid that there could be rioting or looting or violence if certain people don’t like the way the election turns out. And a lot of people have suggested that the tell would be if Donald Trump wins, there could be rioting or looting or things like that. Of course, I know you have said that you would try to put a stop to it. But nonetheless, how do you feel about how we got to this point where if you are reelected, there could be rioting and looting?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","25:10"
"Donald Trump","Well, I tell you, I think it’s very sad. And part of the reason is it’ll all be in Democrat cities, Democrat-run cities. It’s going to be in Chicago, New York and Portland and Oakland, different places, Baltimore. And that’s because of weak leadership. Weak, weak leadership. And my side is a very strong side if they wanted to, but they don’t like doing that. They’re proud of our country. They don’t want to hurt our country. But the other side is radicalized Antifa. And frankly, if you let people know that there would be hell to pay, you wouldn’t have any problem, but they don’t do that. They have the cops stand back, stand back-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","26:16"

"Donald Trump","I looked at that and you see the cops standby and you know they’re good cops. The Philadelphia cops are good cops. They don’t want to stand back, but they’re told to stand back. And these kids and wise guys and anarchists, agitators and looters and rioters, I mean, that’s what they are, that when they see weakness, they go for it. It’s a shame.

"Donald Trump","When the statutes were being affected so badly, where they were knocking down statues, I took an old law… Basically, I modernized a very powerful old law, and you get 10 years in jail if you’re knock down a statute. And since that time, and now this is on a federal basis, cities could do the same thing. We could reinstitute it for cities if asked. But since that time, it just stopped. I mean, it just totally stopped, because people would say, “10 years is just too much.” They would be able to stop this so easily by being tough, frankly, by not allowing-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-election-day-interview-transcript-fox-friends","Donald Trump Election Day Interview Transcript Fox & Friends","27:41"

"Donald Trump","Our country could never be the same country if they win because they’re radicalized left. Joe Biden will never call all the shots, and if he does, he’s not going to be there very long. He’s got a vice president who’s further left than Bernie Sanders, who is not a particularly good person. And she would be, I think, a terrible first representative… If she became the first woman president, I think it would be a terrible thing for our country. I think it would be a terrible thing for women. I look forward to the first woman president, but I don’t look… I wouldn’t look forward to her being that person. I think it would be a very bad thing.

It has been, and it’s love on both sides. I mean, you have 30, 40,000 more people in this big area and you feel the love. It’s so incredible. And that’s what I’m telling you, tucker did an unbelievable piece. He got it. He figured it out, because it’s never happened before in the history of our country, never anything like this. When Biden goes and he has 20 or 30 people, that’s not so different from a lot of other people. If Ronald Reagan came in to do a rally, because he was a popular guy, if he had 200 or 300 people, that’s fine. That’s anticipated. Usually, they’d go to a ballroom and they’d have it in a ballroom. I’m coming in and we’re having 45,000 people. You had to see the rally we had the other night in Miami. Ended at 1:00 in the morning, but people didn’t leave. They didn’t want to leave.
