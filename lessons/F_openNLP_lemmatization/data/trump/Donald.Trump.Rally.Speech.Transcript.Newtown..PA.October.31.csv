"Donald Trump","Thank you very much. Thank you. What an honor. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, thank you. We love this section of the world. It’s a beautiful section. We appreciate it very much, and I’m thrilled to be back in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, so much. Thank you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","02:08"
"Donald Trump","This is the state where the story of American independence began. It’s the state where the American constitution was signed. Think of that. And three days from now, this is the state that will save the American dream. On November 3rd, we’re going to win Pennsylvania, and we’re going to win four more years in that very beautiful White House. We gather today in a very special place. In the harrowing days of December 1776, when the American revolution seemed lost, General George Washington made his headquarters as this Bucks County farmhouse to plan his famous crossing of the Delaware.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","02:42"
"Donald Trump","On Christmas night, he led what remained, and just very little remained, of that rag tag continental army on a daring midnight raid. It was a tough night, it was a violent night. They marched through nine miles of ice and snow, many without boots on their feet, leaving a trail of blood in their wake. At dawn, they seized victory at Trenton. Their sacrifice turned the entire tide of the war. Those soldiers came from every walk of life, but what united them all was their devotion to the principle of self-government. They were determined to live in a country where power belongs to the people. That priceless inheritance is at stake just three days from now, and a great red wave is forming. As sure as you’re there, as sure as we’re here together, and they see it. They see it at all sides, and there’s not a thing they can do about it. This is the fundamental question facing every voter in American. Do you want to be a nation ruled by the corrupt political class, or do you want to be governed by the American people? I ran for office four years ago because I could not sit by and watch any longer as a small group of Washington insiders continued to get rich bleeding America dry.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","03:34"
"Donald Trump","They’re just bleeding America dry. Think of it. Closing our factories, opening our borders, outsourcing our industries, and letting foreign countries ravage our middle class. Career politicians spend trillions of dollars fighting foreign wars, while letting our own cities crumble and decay. Here in Pennsylvania, you know this bitter and very painful betrayal all too well. Better than most. The corrupt Washington class launched an economic war against this state.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","05:26"
"Donald Trump","For decades, they targeted your steel mills, shut down your plants, and sent millions of your jobs overseas, all while lining their pockets with special interest cash, and no one embodies this betrayal and treachery more than Joe Biden. And worst of all, the suppressed media and big tech refuses to cover the crime. They refuse to cover. We’ve learnt so much over the last two weeks. For 47 years, he supported every disastrous trade deal that enriched his cronies and impoverished your state. He wiped out Pennsylvania Steel. He was the cheerleader of NAFTA, and China’s entry into the World Trade organization. Pennsylvania lost 50% of your manufacturing jobs after those Biden disastrous.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","06:02"
"Donald Trump","Then Biden pushed the job killing Paris Climate Accord, an economic nightmare for Pennsylvania miners and every worker in our country. He backed TPP, which would have extinguished the American auto industry forever. Forever. These betrayals not only made Biden’s donors rich, they made his family rich, and as we know, he profited from the misery of unleashed work and horror given to Pennsylvania workers. He made a lot of money, his family made a lot of money, and nobody knew about it until just recently.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","07:29"
"Donald Trump","At the debate, I looked at him and said, “Joe, you were here for 47 years, and you left only three and a half years ago. Why didn’t you do these things that you want done? Why didn’t you fix it, Joe?” And as you know, because I assume a number of you watched the debate … but as you know, he just looked at me and shrugged.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","08:16"
"Donald Trump","In fact, the anchor looked up and said, “Why did you do it?” She couldn’t believe it, and she was on his side. She said, “Why did you do it? Why did you do it and why did you say it?” In 2016, Pennsylvania voted to fire this failed and corrupt political establishment, and you voted for an outsider’s president who is finally putting America first.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","09:07"
"Donald Trump","And if I don’t look like a typical politician, that’s very simple. It’s because I’m not a politician. If I don’t always play by the rules of Washington and the Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you, and I fought harder for you than any president in the history of our country. From day one, Washington insiders have been trying to stop me because they do not own me and they do not control me.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","09:31"
"Donald Trump","They want control. They don’t like what I’m doing. They don’t like what I’ve said to the big pharma, the drug companies, the number one lobbyist in the world, number one lobbyist in our country. They didn’t like that I instituted Favored Nation so that we now pay the lowest prices in the world for prescription drugs, instead of the highest prices in the world.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","10:13"
"Donald Trump","If these corrupt forces succeed in electing Joe Biden, Washington will see to it that another outsider never becomes president again. It’ll never happen again, and nobody has done in three and a half years, nobody, no administration, no president, what we’ve done and what we’ve accomplished, and it’s not even challenged. Nobody even challenges that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","10:41"
"Donald Trump","They’ll take back control and they will never, ever give it up. This once in a lifetime opportunity to beat the corrupt politicians will be lost forever, and they know it. They’re fighting so hard and they hate what they’re seeing because they’re not looking at fake suppression polls anymore. Now they’re looking at the numbers that are pouring in, and they don’t like the numbers that they’re seeing in Florida and in Ohio and in North Carolina.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","11:07"
"Donald Trump","And we think in Pennsylvania, although those numbers come in late. We think in Pennsylvania. They don’t like it. They don’t like it, they don’t like what they see, and I just want to tell you that we have really, things have worked out so well for our country. Nobody had any idea that anything like this could ever happen. If you look at what’s going on over the last four years, we’ve been building the biggest, strongest, and most secure middle class in human history. We built the most powerful military anywhere in the world.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","11:44"
"Donald Trump","And over the next four years, we will make it even stronger. Stronger like nobody thought even possible. Do not be intimidated by our opponents’ angry and menacing tone, because if we were, we would never have been able to accomplish what we’ve accomplished. In truth, they are actually terrified of you, the people. They’re terrified. They’re terrified that you will discover that you have the power to end their corrupt rule once and for all. We have to do it. When you see what’s going on, we have to do it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","12:41"
"Donald Trump","We don’t have a choice. Somebody said, “Do you enjoy this?” I said, “It’s not a question of enjoyment.” Believe it or not I do. I shouldn’t. Have to go check something, but I shouldn’t. But you know, today we’re doing three rallies, tomorrow we’re doing five, and the smallest crowd will be 25,000 people. Then on Monday we’re doing five or six, and I can’t tell you what’s going to happen there, but I think we’ll just go home and rest. But they don’t get to decide this election. This is your choice.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","13:17"
"Donald Trump","We have to be very careful. We have to be very, very careful, especially in this state, more than any other state. They say you have to be very, very careful. What happens in Philadelphia, we have to be extremely, everybody has to watch, vigilant. Your decision, your future is at stake. As your president, I don’t answer to the special interests. I have no interest in it. I don’t take instructions from donors and lobbyists. I don’t care about them. I don’t care about them.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","13:58"
"Donald Trump","I don’t take my orders from the media, or as I affectionately call them, the fake news media. And as you know, they’ve turned out to be far more fake than we ever thought, and they’ve really turned out to be corrupt. They are corrupt. They are really corrupt. The word fake is not strong enough, especially after what we’ve seen where stories, major stories, the biggest story anywhere in the world, is absolutely not covered. It’s hard to have scandal when you have no coverage, and they work in conjunction with big tech, and they protect each other, and they protect the democrats, because with the democrats, you don’t have somebody up talking like I do about them, so they can do whatever they want, and this will only lead to very bad things. I do what is right for America. I do what’s right for America. It’s made me a lot of enemies in Washington but I wear their opposition as a badge of honor.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","14:29"
"Donald Trump","Winston Churchill once said that it was a nation that had the lion heart. I had the luck to give it the roar. I gave it the roar, and there is a roar, and people hear it all over. They heard it four years ago loud and clear. Probably the biggest thing to happen. They talk Brexit, they talk many numerous things, but this is always number one. What happened, 2016? And I will say, 2016 was an incredible earth shaking event, but 2020, and I never thought I’d say this, 2020, what we’re doing right now through Tuesday, what we’re doing is far bigger.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","15:41"
"Donald Trump","It’s far bigger. I never thought I’d say it. I never thought four years ago, and you never did either, somebody would say that this is going to be the most important election perhaps in the history of our country. It’s really amazing. The greatest threat to American democracy is the concentration of power among a small group of unelected special interests. The big tech CEOs who have been put in a position by us giving a law to them, Section 230. We’ve given them that power, and you know that can be taken away.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","16:27"
"Donald Trump","That can be taken away, and probably has to be taken away. I see it better than all. I see it so obviously. I see it because of what I do on social media. For me, it’s very easy to see. I see things that nobody would believe. The corporate media and the mega donors in Washington and Silicon Valley, they’re all lining up behind an opponent that’s going to do whatever they tell him to do. That sleepy Joe Biden. He could’ve been the greatest.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","17:07"
"Donald Trump","You know, if you look, we look at the amount of money that he has raised. Hundreds of millions. 300 million dollars one month. But I could’ve been the greatest of all time. I could’ve been the greatest political fundraiser, because as president all I had to do was call Wall Street, the big banks. I could’ve called the oil companies, I could’ve called all of the big companies. Every single one of them, and I know many of them would’ve given me whatever I wanted, but I chose not to do that, and we did plenty. We have plenty. You can only buy so many commercials. When the air waves are full and you can’t buy anymore, I say, “Where are we going to spend it?”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","17:40"
"Donald Trump","Although we did spend in our case a lot on ground game, which they, I think, forgot this part. As much money as they have, they’re screaming in Florida, “Where’s our ground game? Where’s our ground … ?” Well, it takes a long time. You know what? It took us a year and a half to build that ground game, so we’ll see how it all works out, but they didn’t do that. They decided to go a different route, but they took in massive amounts of money. I could’ve taken in much more than that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","18:25"
"Donald Trump","They did 350. I could’ve done that within an hour. The president is calling. He’d like you to send 25 million dollars, please. Who’s going to tell me no? Nobody. But the problem is, the problem is when they call in six months needing a favor that’s worth billions, it’s very hard, especially me being a loyal person, not a dishonest person, but a loyal person, it’s very hard for me to say, “No, I don’t want to take his call, his or her call, no, I don’t want to do it.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","18:52"
"Donald Trump","Really, you’re compromised. It would’ve compromised our nation, so I didn’t want to do that. Joe Biden works for them. I know them very well. I know them far better than he does. I know him far better than he. Some are friends. Some are actually very surprised when I say, “You don’t have to bother, don’t worry.” I don’t think we can buy anymore anyway, right? But he works for them, and when you see those numbers, 300, 350 million, so much they don’t know what to do with it, where they’re spending 25, 30 million dollars on a congressional race that used to spend 500,000 dollars, you know something’s going on, and it’s not a good thing, and it’s not the way I want to work.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","19:22"
"Donald Trump","This was one opportunity to do something special. This isn’t a company, this isn’t making some money. This is one opportunity to turn our country around, and we’re not going to blow it. He works for them. Not for you, and it is I who work for you. I am working for you. It’s like, not used to that, too much, but I’ve gotten used to it, and we have this great opportunity together, and our people tend to vote, in particular this state, you tend to vote on the 3rd.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","20:04"
"Donald Trump","I could say, “Go in and early vote, don’t wait til Tuesday, vote today, vote tomorrow, vote on Monday.” But I’m wasting a lot of time, because you want to go. It’s tradition, it’s habit. It’s the history of this state. Look at what you’ve done with this state. Look at the history of this state with respect to our country, and you want to go, I won’t even say go today, go tomorrow, go the next day, or go on the 3rd. We want election day. Thank you. Election day.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","20:42"
"Donald Trump","And we have others like that, too. We have others like that, too. They want election day. It’s going to be a great day. The more these corrupt forces oppose me the more I know we are delivering real change, real progress, and historic victories for the American people. We have done great things with the country including our military, our vets. The biggest tax and regulation cuts in history.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","21:13"
"Donald Trump","We just received a poll, this was a real poll, not a suppression poll, where the vets gave us a 91% approval rating for the job that we’re doing. Think of that. 91%. The highest ever.

"Donald Trump","… we’ve been building the strongest and most secure middle class in human history. We have built the most powerful military in the world by far. Nobody has ever built what we’ve built. And when I came in, we had a depleted military. We had old planes. We used to get parts by going to the airplane graveyards and taking the old parts out of old planes that were sitting there rusting of the sun. And crazy weather where they store them in the deserts. And that’s what we were doing. We had a depleted, a terribly depleted military. And now we have the best equipment anywhere in the world by far, all made in the U.S.A. And as I say, we are the envy of every world, we are the envy of every world power, from China to Russia, North Korea. They look at us and they say, “Wow, what they’ve done?” New jets, new fighter jets, bombers, tanks, missiles, rockets, nuclear. And just hope to God that we never have to use it. Hope to God we never have to use it. But it’s less likely that we’ll ever have to use it when we have it. Okay, when we have it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","22:03"
"Donald Trump","We were in very bad shape militarily, a general came to see me, highly overrated general came to see me actually, one of the world’s most overrated generals. And he said, “Sir, we have no ammunition.” Right at the beginning, you know what I’m talking about because we could have had conflict. He said, “Sir, could you hold it off? We have no ammunition.” And I said, “General, no president should ever hear that statement again. We have no ammunition. “Well, now we have so much ammunition. Our problem is, we have no storage.

"Donald Trump","They are incredible people. And I was in Fort Bragg yesterday and I met a lot of the incredible, these incredible, talented, strong, both physically and mentally, the strongest, the best in the world. But we had a mission sent to a far away land where they kidnapped an American citizen. And the kidnappers wished they had never done it. And they went in with a large group, zero casualties. We got our American citizen, young man, we got our young man back. But the other side suffered gravely, I can tell you that. Our nation salutes its courageous military, which brilliantly executed this operation. Very few people would have been able to do it. It was very complicated and a very complex, tough area. We celebrate the safe return home of an American hostage. We’ve got many hostages home. And I pay nothing, nothing, can’t pay. Once you pay, you’ll have many, many more. We’re 40 [inaudible 00:25:48] Robert O’Brien who’s doing a tremendous job said to me, “Sir, you’re 48 and 0.” 48 and O, think of that, we’ve brought many, many of them home.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","24:30"
"Donald Trump","Some mostly in pretty good shape, some in very, very, bad shape. Specifically, you know who I’m talking about. Came home in very bad shape. But sometimes that happens too. But we’ve brought many home, but we don’t pay. You pay, once you pay, your numbers will go up a thousand fold. We’re boldly standing up to China. We achieved the most secure border in American history, our Southern border. We’ve obtained in just a short period of time, American energy independence.

I said, “I don’t think I’m going to do that.” But I watched those sunglasses. I don’t know, to me it didn’t work. We’re bringing our jobs, our factories, our wealth, and our troops all back home.

And instead of endless wars in countries that even you very sophisticated people in some cases have never even heard of, we’re achieving one historic peace after another, if you look.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","26:41"
"Donald Trump","Middle East, we already have three signed up. We have many countries who want to sign, we’re signing them rapidly. And even with Kosovo and Serbia, we’re doing a trade deal with each, a routine trade deal. When I heard about it, I said, “Wait a minute, they’ve been killing for decades. They’ve been killing and killing for decades each other, fighting all the time.” We’re doing a trade deal, they want it. They always want us, all of them want us, the whole world wants us. So we’re in a great negotiating position. But I said, “Kosovo, Serbia, we’re doing a trade deal. You tell them we’re not going to do the deal unless they make peace.” Then all of a sudden they were hugging in the Oval Office.

We said, no, we’re not going to make the deal unless you two start getting … you’re killing each other for decades and decades, that’s all they do is they kill each other. And when I saw the two leaders hugging in the Oval Office and I mean, I think they were exhausted, frankly. I think it was time, it was time, but somebody had to say do it, just seemed to make a lot of sense. I said, “Wait a minute, let’s do it.” And we did it, so I’m very happy about that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","28:27"

We’ve got it, we’ve get great companies, Johnson and Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer, all with a vaccine. All with a different, little different versions of it, some similar, some similar concepts. And many other companies and we’re ready, we’ll have that, and we will have it. But even if you didn’t, and I say, it drives them crazy. We’re rounding the turn, we’re rounding that turn, we’re rounding it. And our economy went down less than any economy anywhere in the world. And it went up faster by far. They keep hearing about Europe, Europe, Europe, well, they’re not doing nearly as well. Seniors will be first in line for the vaccine. And the vaccine will be free because it’s not their fault. It was China’s fault. China did this to us. And our vaccine will eradicate the virus and end the pandemic once and for all.

"Donald Trump","By slashing red tape and cutting bureaucracy, we’re producing this vaccine in record time. If Joe Biden were president, you wouldn’t have this vaccine for four years. And he had his chance with the H1N1, he calls it in reverse, swine flu, which was a disaster. We’ve moved heaven and earth to produce the vaccine ahead of schedule and manufacture hundreds of millions of doses in advance, all ready to be shipped. And we have our military is going to be shipping it. Logistics, we have a general, that’s what he does. He delivers troops. He said, “Sir, this is easy. We’ll get it done very quickly.” It’s the most advanced medical operation anywhere in the world and in history. Thanks to the therapies we’ve accelerated, we have already reduced the mortality rate. 85%, think of the that, down 85%.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","30:24"

But we’re doing great, but we just don’t get credit for it. We don’t get credit. And I don’t want the credit personally, but I want the generals and the admirals, and our great Vice President Mike Pence, who worked so hard. All of the people on the task force and Jared Kushner, what he did, he’s here someplace. But he was fantastic on the ventilators. Ventilators are very, very complex.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","31:23"
"Donald Trump","Oh, look at that, Jared, and he wants no praise, he couldn’t care less. He truly couldn’t care. Thank you, Jared. No, we had a tremendous … just a quick story, we had a tremendous ventilator problem because we weren’t equipped for a thing like this. This is once in 100 years, 1918, we’re talking about, the Spanish Flu. And we weren’t equipped for that. And all of a sudden we’re getting calls. We need 40,000 ventilators. Like in New York, they needed far less than that, but they needed many, many ventilators. And other states are calling, we need ventilators. And it’s a very complicated piece of equipment, as you can imagine with pipes going down, heavily computerized. And people didn’t know what to do, making them on a mass scale like this, hospitals had very few of them.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","32:16"
"Donald Trump","And Jared called up some of his genius friends, his brother is one of the most important people in Silicon Valley, smart family. They called up and they had these super brilliant young men come in. I mean, some of them were wearing undershirts, they were wearing a [inaudible 00:33:26]. They’re wearing a baseball cap. “How much are you worth?” “About a billion dollars, sir.” They had founded companies, sold their companies, but they were brilliant. One of them had roller skates on and they wanted to throw him out of the White House. They said, “Sir, there’s a kid here, undershirt and rollerskates.” I said, “Yeah, he’s worth two and half billion dollars.” But Jared called a whole group of people down. And to them, to us, to all of us, a ventilator is very complicated. To them it’s like the simplest machine they’ve ever seen.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","33:11"
"Donald Trump","And they went to the automobile companies where they had excess plant capacity. And they went to various companies. And we started producing within a short period of time, ventilators. And this story is just never told, and I don’t think I’ve ever told it, not in this detail. We started producing ventilators in a short period of time at a level that nobody thought was … thousands and thousands … nobody thought was even possible. And in a relatively short period of time, after that, all of our hospitals were sent tens of thousands of ventilators, tens of thousands of ventilators. Great companies, very big companies, the car companies, very big companies. They did a fantastic job. They’d line up with a small ventilator company, and we make the best ventilators, I mean, they say they’re the best.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","34:02"
"Donald Trump","And they were sent all over our country. And think of it, and that was done so quickly. But these brilliant young people were able to do it. Regular people could … I mean, you could never do a thing like this. So we made thousands a month and not one person, think of this, in our country, not one person who needed a ventilator didn’t get a ventilator, how incredible is that? But they won’t tell that story. That’s not me, that’s Jared and a whole group of very brilliant people, together with the military and with a lot of great companies. We’ve had a tremendous relationship. It’s the biggest mobilization since World War II. And it was an incredible job. Now what we’re doing is we’re making … we continue to make thousands a month and we’re sending them to foreign countries who were desperate for ventilators. And would have no idea, there would be no way they could ever get them.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","34:53"
"Donald Trump","Including, I mean, we sent them to France and we sent them to Spain, and Italy, but we send them to countries in Africa, who are really having a terrible hard time. And we’re sending thousands of them to other countries. And I just think it’s a tremendous story. And it’s something that we did that we’re very proud of. And I did something that nobody talks about. You don’t hear about … you don’t hear the word ventilators anymore. You know why you don’t hear about it because we solved … There was a period of time, ventilators, for three, four or five weeks until they sent these super geniuses in. For three, four, five weeks, all you’ve heard about was ventilators, ventilators, ventilators. Well, we took over something, the cupboards were bare. They were bare, or essentially bare, but they were bare. And the hospitals in the states, the cupboards were bare too. Nobody was prepared for a thing like this. That could have been, they should have been.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","35:51"
"Donald Trump","But now all over the world we’re sending them and I think it’s just a tremendous story, I really do. It’s a story that’s untold, you’ll probably never hear that again. And as soon as we started making all of these thousands of ventilators, you haven’t heard the word ventilator just like … and there’s one other quick story. The wall, the wall, the wall, that’s all you heard. Trump promised the wall, will he ever give the wall? The wall, the wall. And then now the wall is going to be completed very quickly. We have over 400 miles of wall built. And now you never hear the word wall. They never say, “Oh, he got the wall, he did it.” And we built it exactly to the specifications of the border patrol. And they were tough specs, I will tell you. I said, “How about concrete plank?” “No, sir, we need steel, we need rebar and we also need concrete.” “Oh, that’s great.” But we got it built and they have to have vision. They have to have slats because they have to be able to see through what’s on the other side.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","36:45"
"Donald Trump","You can’t have … once you realize this, I mean, they’re right. So we built it to those specs. Very, very … they’ve done an incredible job. We’re doing 10 miles a week. We’ll be finished very soon. But you never hear about the wall anymore. Now if it was a failure, if we couldn’t get it done, it would be brutal. It would be a brutal time for your president. Because of our relentless efforts, the recovery rate right now on COVID or the China virus or the China plague is 99.7%, think of that, 99.7%. And I’m here, I’m here, right? I’m here. And these two great people whose property we’re using today, what a historic property. And all I know is they said … we just drove up the road, they’ve been here a long time, but not as long as George Washington, right, but they’ve been here a long time. And they said, and you’ve probably many of you said, do you see the crowds along … It looks at Broadway, except a slightly more picturesque, slightly more picturesque. But it’s thousands and thousands of people lined all the way down to the highways, it’s incredible, and they’re all waving flags.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","37:44"
"Donald Trump","Most importantly, they’re all waving flags and they’re proud of our nation. And I guess it has something to do with Pennsylvania. I’m going to be here all day today. But no, it’s a beautiful site and they were very proud, and thank you very much for everything you’ve done. We’re allowing younger, healthier Americans to resume normal activities while strongly protecting the elderly and those at high risk. And we’re making the powerful antibody treatment that I received available to anybody that needs it, free, free. Wasn’t their fault. But I had that and I didn’t feel good. I said, “What’s going on?” And test positive, and I’m the President of the United States, I couldn’t bury myself in a basement of the White House as nice as it is. I actually got to see it one time, it’s very nice.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","39:15"
"Donald Trump","Like you would expect, it’s a beautiful basement, it’s in the White House. It’s a very solid basement. But I couldn’t do that. And I couldn’t put myself in a beautiful room upstairs, beautiful bedroom, and stay there for a year and a half. I’m the President. And I go to meetings, I’d say “That’s a lot of people.” And then one day that happens. And I said I wasn’t feeling good. And the doctor came in and … great doctors, great White House doctors, Sean. They came in and they said, “Sir, you’ve tested positive.” I said, “Tested positive for what? And they said, “For COVID, for COVID.” He actually used the term COVID, he’s more politically correct than I am. I said, “That’s not good.” But I didn’t feel good and we went over to Walter Reed Medical Center, which is phenomenal. I see the work they’re doing, young men coming back so badly, and women, so badly wounded.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","40:11"
"Donald Trump","I see what they can do, what they can do and nobody can do what they can do. And Johns Hopkins was great. We had a lot of doctors gathered around. But I didn’t feel good and they gave me something, Regeneron, and Eli Lilly makes a very similar kind of a thing. The concept is based on antibodies. And I woke up the next morning and I felt so great, I wanted to rip that Superman shirt open. I wanted to come back. I wanted to start doing a new trade deal and campaigning simultaneously. They said, “Sir, how about taking it easy for a couple of days?” But no, it’s incredible. What we’ve been able to do is … and I don’t even know. Maybe now I’m saying, well, it probably wasn’t the drug, it’s just that I’m in such perfect physical condition. And I’m very young, if you’re young, so I said that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","41:08"
"Donald Trump","And CNN got very upset [inaudible 00:42:10]. Their camera just went off, the light. They got upset. They said, “He is not young and he’s not in perfect shape.” I said, “I’m a great physical specimen.” They didn’t like it when I said that. They don’t like those kind of things. No, but I don’t know, maybe I helped, I don’t know. But I can tell you it’s incredible what they’ve been able to do. And I think it did help a lot, frankly, because I got out of there fast. I could have gotten out a lot sooner too. I wanted to go out almost immediately. They said, “Nice and easy, please, sir.” But shows you, maybe I serve as an example, First Lady got it also and she’s better. She’s perfect. And Barron Trump, right? Barron, Barron got it. My young boy, he’s 14 years old, my young, tall boy, I say, he’s very tall. He’s a good guy, good-looking guy and strong. So he has it. They say, “Sir, Barron tested positive also.” I said, “Wow.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","42:07"
"Donald Trump","Then I go, this was at the beginning, I go, I say to the doctor, like 12 minutes later, “Doctor, how’s Barron doing?” “Oh, he’s okay, sir, he sloughed it off.” You know why, they’re young and their immune system works. That’s why I say, get back to school, get back to school. Get back to school, open up this state, Governor, open up this state. And don’t take advantage of those ballots, Governor, don’t do it, don’t do it.

"Donald Trump","We will terminate the virus with science, medicine, and groundbreaking therapies and cures. I watched Joe Biden speak yesterday. All he does is talk about COVID, COVID. He’s got nothing else to say, “COVID, COVID, COVID.” We agree. It’s serious and we’ve done an incredible job. And at some point, they’re going to recognize that. I said we’ve done an A+ job, but I give ourselves a D or maybe an F in terms of public relations, but now I’ll start talking about it a little bit.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","44:03"
"Donald Trump","When Joe Biden was Vice President, his failed approach on the swine flu was, as I said, a total disaster and his chief of staff said that he had no idea what he was doing. I don’t know why this guy said this. And now, they’re thinking about bringing him into the administration. I guess, probably this is maybe before the flu came along or something because I’m saying, “Why would he say this?” He goes, quote, “We did every possible thing wrong and 60 million Americans got H1N1,” far less lethal, by the way, far less lethal. “And in that period of time, and it’s just purely fortuitous that this isn’t one of the great mass casualty events in American history.” This is Biden’s chief of staff. Think of what he said. Where did this guy come? You’re going to bring him back? It had nothing to do with anything we did. We didn’t do anything right.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","44:32"
"Donald Trump","Now, think of this. And then he’s saying, “We want to take over what you’re doing.” Right? He says, “We want to take over.” Remember he said, when he first started running, that I did a poor job because I didn’t act fast enough. I acted in January. We had almost no deaths. Think of this. And I said, “China is heavily infected. They can’t come in.” And I went up against Dr. Fauci and others that said, “No, no. You shouldn’t do this. You shouldn’t do it.” I said, “Listen, they’re infected, heavily infected. Let’s close off China.” So I did that. I closed off Europe. I did that and, Fauci will tell you, saved tens of thousands of lives. Much more than that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","45:32"
"Donald Trump","And then when you think, okay, we saved thousands and thousands of lives and then Biden is campaigning. And he was two and a half months later, he said, “We have to get tough,” and he called me xenophobic because I closed. Two and a half months later, then he runs and he said, “He should’ve closed the country earlier.” I said, “I don’t think he’s going to get away with that.” And let’s see what happens on November 3rd because, if something happens that’s wrong where he did, then he did get away with that. Now, here’s a guy, not the smartest guy out there and he never was, but now in particular he’s not doing so well, but here’s somebody that says that I didn’t act early enough and, for two and a half months, he was scolding everybody saying that they shouldn’t have closed off China, they shouldn’t have done and that nothing bad is going to happen.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","46:12"
"Donald Trump","But remember the statement from his … That was his chief of staff made that statement. We mourn for every life lost to the China virus and in their memory and their sacred memory. We truly do. We mourn. It should’ve never happened. We will defeat the virus and emerge stronger and more unified than ever before. That’s all we can say. We’re going to be more unified than ever before. Our economy is now surging back faster, better, bigger, and stronger than any nation on earth. We just had the best quarter of economic growth ever recorded, by more than double. A 33.1% increase, more than our great number from 1952. That was the number we [inaudible 00:47:59] but more than double. And you know what? The press is refusing to talk about it. It’s not even a major story.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","47:06"
"Donald Trump","One of the analysts said today it was the greatest economic number that they have ever seen. GDP up 33.1%. That means it grew 33 … in a quarter. And the press barely mentions it, not even on the front page of newspapers because that’s the game they play. It’s suppression. That’s why we have to win. We can’t let them do this. We have to win. This was according to a certain very important person, Larry Kudlow, who’s a terrific guy and other people. Sir, this is the greatest financial number probably ever recorded in our country. Think of that. That’s a big statement. And double, more than double a number from 1952 and it’s barely covered. And that’s only for one reason; because they want us to do very poorly on November 3rd. They don’t want to tell the American public about this.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","48:07"
"Donald Trump","The one advantage I do have is I do have a way of getting the word out, but it’s very tough when they pick it up. Even this, they won’t pick this up. I made a statement, strong statement. They won’t pick it up because it’s good news. They’ll fabricate stories. They’ll make up false stories. They’ll put you number one on Twitter all the time, stories that aren’t trending. These stories are so boring. They’ll make up … The Times will write false stories all the time, and yet they won’t talk about the Biden corruption. They won’t talk about where’s Hunter and they won’t talk about … Don’t feel bad. The cameras are all off. Don’t worry. We just lost the last camera.

They won’t talk about the fact that the wife of the Mayor of Moscow gave him $3.5 million. For what? They won’t talk about the fact that the father went to China and Air Force to … where’s Hunter? Where’s [inaudible 00:50:24]? I put his first name, his real first name is Where. We’re going to make it Where. Where’s Hunter was with him. And in 10 minutes, he walked out with $1.5 billion to manage, which is millions of dollars in fees, millions and millions.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","49:52"
"Donald Trump","And they won’t talk about the fact that he was going for the big one next when China asked for $10 million a year for introductory purpose. In other words, he was going to introduce people $10 million a year. This is a payoff. That’s all it is. And they won’t talk about the fact that the father was the big guy. To me, he’s not a big guy. Little guy. He’s very slight. Remember when he said a year ago, he said, “I’d like to take him to the back of the barn?” I went like this. I’ll take him to the back of the barn. The glasses. Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country, if we don’t raise taxes. If Joe Biden is elected, he will delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, close down schools and impose a nationwide lockdown. That’s what they’re talking … Can you imagine going … And we’re making the greatest comeback of any country by far and they’re actually talking … He’s talking about a lockdown. He has no clue, but he’s talking about it. That’s his only plan, to make you a prisoner in your home, a prisoner in your own country and, under the Biden lockdown, the recovery will be totally killed. The economy will crash. The country can’t afford it. The people can’t afford it, but country can’t. Can you imagine?

The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will be opened on November 4th.” No, because they can’t be so stupid, what they’re doing to people. And the countless people that will die from depression and drug overdoses and suicide and abuse and, really, a deferral of medical care. There’ll be no school. There’ll be no graduations.

Well, now we’ve given it the all-time mass test. A child being in a classroom or, if you’re older, a campus, even a college campus, but a child being in a classroom cannot be replaced by a computer. It can’t. It doesn’t work. It’s no good. And they’re losing potentially years out of their life and it’s the important years. It’s the development years, but the computers don’t work.

It’s starting all over again. They just don’t. It’s a terrible thing that was unleashed on us and we should never forget what happened. We should never, ever forget that China could’ve stopped it. They stopped it from going into the rest of China, but not from going to Europe, the United States, and the rest of the world.

Today’s left tolerates no challenge and allows no descent. You see that. They have them locked down. That’s the ultimate lockdown. You can do horrible things or you can do nothing wrong and they’ll put in stories. I’m actually a victim of the opposite. I’m just thinking about when I’m talking to you. They do phony stories that are totally false and they’ll put them up and there’s nothing you can do. There’s nothing you can do except explain it away.

Thank goodness they have lousy ratings. Thank goodness. And I call it MSDNC. What they do is just absolutely … It’s not even thinkable. It’s not even to be believed.

Let’s speak in front of the 250.” What I didn’t know is that thousands of people were going, anyway. They just went.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","59:49"

Laura Ingraham had a show last night. She said, “I’ve worked for everybody. I’ve worked for Reagan and nobody’s ever seen anything like what’s happening.” It’s a great thing. It’s an incredible thing. This is supposed to be a little special speech, but you’ve never seen anything like this. Nobody’s ever seen it. And what happened is, I think because of what they did when they said, “We’re going to silence his voice,” it turned out to be a much bigger voice, and I think we now are going to … 1972, Minnesota hasn’t been won.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","01:00:30"

And I think we will win Minnesota. We were very close last time. And we should win it, when they let Minneapolis burn. We should win it, but I think we’re going to win it. And again, 1972 was the last time. Can you believe that? I think we’re going to do it. We’ll find out. You’re going to know in about … Well, I hope, based on the Supreme Court, they don’t delay it too long, this decision yesterday. I will tell you, it was not a good decision. You’re allowed to wait days to count and days to have the final count? You’re allowed to have time limits beyond November 3rd? So what does this mean?

And very bad things can happen with ballots during that period of November 3rd to whatever date they gave them. Many, many days. So you’re going to be watching on November 3rd.

November 3rd is going to come and go and we’re not going to know. And you’re going to have bedlam in our country and you’re going to have this period of nine days or seven days or whatever it is. And many bad things … Ballots are going to be … “Oh, we just found 10,000 ballots.” “Oh, that’s good.” “We just found another 10,000.” This is a horrible thing that the United States Supreme Court has done to our country. And I say it and I say it loud and I say it proud. We have to know who won. We have to know who won. They tell you the police officers are villains. This is the group. And they’re heroes. No. These even tell you that your children must be indoctrinated to believe that the heroes who crossed the Delaware were driven by hatred and malice. They change your history. A vote for Joe Biden is a vote to give this radical movement absolute power and unchecked control over every aspect of American life. Joe Biden, who’s not … he’s not all there. You should get a little bit of a larger frame, don’t you think? No, there. I know those glasses. You’ve got to get a little … I’ll tell him.

You can’t go to church. What they’re doing to our churches and our synagogues and all of that is just terrible. You see what’s going on.

"Donald Trump","There is only one way to preserve, protect, and defend the American way of life. You must show up on November 3rd, okay? Don’t worry about the first or second, because I know you too well. The Biden/Harris economic policies of increasing taxes and regulations, biggest tax increase in the history of our country is what they’re proposing. Would pulverize our middle-class. Their plan is projected to hammer the typical American family’s income by over $6,500 a year in the Wall Street Journal. By contrast, I cut taxes and regulations at a level nobody’s ever done before, and raised middle-class families incomes’ over $6,000 in just three short years. And that’s not including energy, which is a tremendous, what we’ve done with energy is tremendous. Joe Biden has pledged a $4 trillion tax hike, socialized medicine, an avalanche of job killing regulations, a return to globalist trade deals. And he vowed the total destruction of the Pennsylvania oil industry and fracking, fracking has gone. Fracking is gone. Man. He said that loud and clear for a year until he realized that he has to win in Pennsylvania. But fracking is dead because they’re side it’s dead.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","01:06:21"
"Donald Trump","You saw AOC go out and say, no, no, no, you can’t say that when Biden switched and he never had one question from the press, how could you say it for a year, and then all of a sudden switch when you walk into Pennsylvania. Now, fracking would be dead. Joe Biden’s plan to abolish American energy is an economic death sentence for Pennsylvania. A vote for Biden is a vote to ban fracking and to send your state into a nightmare of poverty and depression, that’s what’s going to happen. It’s your single biggest industry by far, probably a million jobs one way or the other and what it would do to our country because our country has low energy costs. You and Texas and others. Think of Texas. He’s running in Texas. We’re doing very well in Texas, but if you believe the fake news, they’ll tell you, “Oh, it’s very close.” It’s not close at all. And it wasn’t close four years ago. Think of Texas. It’s very close.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","01:07:55"
"Donald Trump","He’s against oil, he’s against guns, and he’s against religion. And then they say, “Texas is very close.” Think of that, right? He’s against oil, guns, and God, Texas is very close, too close to call. I don’t think so. I think Texas, Texas is going to be very strong for us. Can you imagine going into Texas, say we’re going to take your guns away, and by the way, we’re going to close up every oil well that you have. Vote for me, vote for Joe. I don’t think so. I don’t think so. If Biden wins, there will be no fracking, no oil, no natural gas, no jobs, and no future. Under Biden, gas prices will explode, family incomes will plummet, and the fracking industry will be outlawed forever. Forever. With your vote, I will cut middle-class taxes even more. I mean, we cut them at the highest level in the history of our country, even more, and you saw what it did. That’s why we’re coming back so quick, because we have a strong foundation, a base.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","01:08:51"

Joe Biden would appoint the most radical left wing cabinet in history. Beto O’Rourke will be in charge of gun confiscation. Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren will be in charge of the United States Treasury, according to what they say. AOC plus three will run the climate policy. I wonder if she ever even took a course in climate? I don’t think so, I didn’t say it, you did. This can only happen in Pennsylvania. Don’t forget, I went to school here. He likes to throw around the Pennsylvania thing. Look at it differently. He abandoned Pennsylvania. He went to Delaware, but I’m not blaming.

Kamala Harris, she makes Bernie Sanders look like a very strict conservative. Kamala, got to say the name exactly right or they excoriate you. So you have Kamala running the White House. Well, she already said that, right? She said that it’s the Harris/Biden. He actually said that, that was scary. He said under the Harris, I never did that. I never said under the Pence/Trump administration. And I love Mike Pence. You know what? But I said, “Mike, that far we can’t go.” But he said, he may never say, he also said he’s running for the US Senate two or three times. He said, “I’m a proud Democrat.” This is like three, four times. “I’m a proud Democrat running for the US Senate.” And we said, “No, Joe, you’re running for president.” “Oh, okay.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-newtown-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Newtown, PA October 31","01:11:43"

The other thing he does badly, haven’t done it yet, I hope I never do, but he’ll be making a speech in Ohio, ladies and gentlemen of Iowa, it’s proud to be. The worst is when he’s making one in Miami with the palm trees. The beautiful palm trees. “Ladies and gentlemen of Ohio.” He’s made that many times. And you know what I always say? Winston Churchill was a great, great order, right? Amazing orator, amazingly, because he was a stutterer in his life. He was a stutter and became a great orator. You could give a speech equal to the best that he’s ever made. And if you made the mistake in saying welcome, like we’re in Pennsylvania, it’s great to be in New York. It doesn’t matter how good your speech is, it’s over. Just walk off, it’s over. But he does it all the time, and nobody even says it.

This so falls based on a phony magazine, an Obama type magazine, that’s doing badly. They did a commercial, and we notified them. And we had 26 witnesses, real witnesses. And every one of them is furious, but he’s not a nice person. So because he’s not a nice person, I don’t mind saying exactly what I’m saying, which as you know is the truth. He was never considered smart in his prime, but now he’s really off. And you can’t have him as your president because he’ll destroy our country. He’ll destroy our country.

Nobody spoke worse about him, and that’s the one that they pick, but they want to get the radical left. They’d love to get her in. And that will be a very, I don’t know.

Biden’s planned to admit unlimited low wage foreign workers will slash incomes, surge unemployment, and devastate the middle class, all to enrich the globalist donors. As president, my only special interest is you. That is true. My only special interest. To protect our national security, I also suspended the entry of refugees from foreign nations compromised by terrorism, just call up President Macron as I do often, and ask him what’s happening over there?

Biden’s extreme migration policies will open the flood gates to terrorists, jihadists and violent extremists. You don’t have to worry about it, just get out and vote on November 3rd. Under my administration, I had the ban passed, right? And it was approved by the United States Supreme Court. There, they did the right thing. Under my administration, the safest of our families will always come first. That safety, we want safety, has to come first.

In fact, Obama tried to keep Joe from running. He was very famously quoted as saying, “Joe, you don’t have to do this. You don’t have to do this, Joe, don’t do it. You don’t have to do this.” I could see that. And then wouldn’t endorse him until long after the primaries had ended and Joe has lost. Think of it. He wouldn’t endorse him. He was a vice president, wouldn’t endorse him. Made all these terrible statements, wouldn’t endorse him. And then even after he won, it was months before he endorsed him, because he didn’t want to see it happen. I think he’s probably the most surprised person on Earth, Obama.

Look at what’s going on in Philadelphia. They should call us into Philadelphia. We’ll solve the problem, or let their police handle the problem. Let their police handle the problem. If elected, the Democrat ticket will pass legislation to end cash bail, create sanctuary cities nationwide, and defund police departments all across America.

He took you for granted, and then he shipped away your jobs and flooded your cities with cheap foreign labor. He devastated black families with his 1994 crime bill that really locked up tens of thousands of African-American men with unfair sentencing. And he called African American young men, super predators all the time. He would say super predators, a name that has always been something, there has been no name that they’ve hated more. They hated it with Hillary Clinton and they hate it with Joe Biden. Super predator, the term super predator. That was his term. He forged close relationships with pro segregation lawmakers and his trade deals decimated the black middle class. Joe Biden cares more about refugees living thousands of miles away that he does about Black Americans living in Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Detroit, Baltimore, Oakland. He’s done nothing. And then he says to me, “Oh, we should do this.” I said, “Joe, again, always, so easy.” 47 years. But he left. It was only three and a half years ago.
