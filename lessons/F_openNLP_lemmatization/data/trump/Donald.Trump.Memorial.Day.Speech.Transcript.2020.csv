"President Donald Trump","In this place more than 200 years ago, American patriots stood their ground and repelled a British invasion in the Battle of Baltimore during the War of 1812. Early on a September morning in 1814, the British fleet launched an assault on this peninsula. From the Harbor, some 30 British warships attack this stronghold. Rockets rained down, bombs burst in the air, and the deck of one ship, a gallant young American was held captive. His name was Francis Scott Key. For 25 hours, Key watched in dismay as fire crashed down upon this ground. But through torrents of rain and smoke and the den of battle, Key could make out 15 broad stripes and 15 bright stars barraged and battered but still there.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-memorial-day-speech-transcript-2020","Donald Trump Memorial Day Speech Transcript 2020","02:51"
"President Donald Trump","American Forces did not waiver. They did not retreat. They stared down the invasion and they held that they had to endure, the fact is they held like nobody could have held before. They held this fort. The British retreated. Independence was saved. Francis Scott Key was so inspired by the sight of our flag in the battle waged that the very grounds that he fought on became hallowed. And he wrote a poem. His ageless words became the anthem of our nation, The Star Spangled Banner.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-memorial-day-speech-transcript-2020","Donald Trump Memorial Day Speech Transcript 2020","03:55"
"President Donald Trump","Every time we sing our anthem, every time it’s rousing chorus swells our hearts with pride, we renew the eternal bonds of loyalty to our fallen heroes. We think of the soldiers who spend their final heroic moments on distant battlefields to keep us safe at home. We remember the young Americans who never got the chance to grow old but whose legacy will outlive us all. In every generation, these Intrepid souls kiss goodbye to their families and loved ones. They took flight in plane, set sail in ships, and marched into battle with our flag fighting for our country, defending our people.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-memorial-day-speech-transcript-2020","Donald Trump Memorial Day Speech Transcript 2020","04:41"
"President Donald Trump","When the cause of liberty was in jeopardy, American warriors carried that flag through ice and snow to victory at Trenton. They hoisted it up the mass of great battleships in Manila Bay. They fought through hell to raise it high atop a remote Island in the Pacific Ocean called Iwo Jima. From the Philippine Sea to Fallujah, from New Orleans to Normandy, from Saratoga to Sipan, from the Battle of Baltimore to the Battle of the Bulge, Americans gave their lives to carry that flag through piercing waves, blazing fires, sweltering deserts, and storms of bullets and shrapnel. They climbed atop enemy tanks, jumped out of burning airplanes, and leaped on live grenades. Their love was boundless. Their devotion was without limit. Their courage was beyond measure.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-memorial-day-speech-transcript-2020","Donald Trump Memorial Day Speech Transcript 2020","05:30"
"President Donald Trump","Army Green Beret Captain Daniel Eggers grew up in Cape Coral, Florida determined to continue his family tradition of military service. And it was a great tradition. He attended the legendary Citadel Military College in South Carolina. Soon he met a beautiful cadet, Rebecca. They fell in love, married and had two sons. In 2004, Daniel left for his second deployment in Afghanistan. On the morning of May 29th, Daniel and his team were courageously pursuing a group of deadly terrorists when he was killed by an improvised explosive device. This week is the 16th anniversary of the day that Daniel made the supreme sacrifice for our nation.

"President Donald Trump","One was World War II veteran, Jim Krebs from Sunbury, Ohio. Jim and his twin brother Jack fought side by side in General Patton’s Third Army. At the Battle of the Bulge, the twins volunteered for a dangerous mission. Together they took out four enemy tanks, two machine gun nests at a mother position that was very powerful. Loaded up with mortars, Jim’s brother Jack was mortally wounded. Jim held his dying brother in his arms, praying together as his twin passed away. Jim fought to victory and came home to build a great American life.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-memorial-day-speech-transcript-2020","Donald Trump Memorial Day Speech Transcript 2020","09:49"
"President Donald Trump","He married, had children, became an electrical engineer, and taught young people about war. As an old man, Jim was asked, what about the American flag and what it meant to him? Jim said, “The flag to me is as precious as the freedom that the flag stands for. It’s as precious to me as the thousands of lives that have been lost defending her. It’s that important to me. It gave me a value of life that I could have never gotten any other way. It gave me a value of my Lord, my family, my friends, loved ones, and especially my country. What more could I ask?”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-memorial-day-speech-transcript-2020","Donald Trump Memorial Day Speech Transcript 2020","10:32"
