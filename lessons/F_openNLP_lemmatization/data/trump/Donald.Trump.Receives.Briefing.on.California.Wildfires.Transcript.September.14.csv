"Donald Trump","Secretary of Homeland security, Chad Wolf, FEMA administrator, Pete Gayner, and all of the people, state local leaders, they join us today and we’re having a separate news conference a little bit later on some other subjects. And I just want to thank everybody. It’s been pretty amazing. In August, I approved a major disaster declaration for California. I’ve approved… I think Gavin about 40 Stafford Act declarations. So very quickly because we want to get this thing taken care of, including fire management, assistant grants, to help multiple states stop the fires. More than 28,000 firefighters and first responders are combating the fires in California, Oregon, and Washington. Over 230 soldiers are fighting the August complex fire, and that’s the largest fire in California. That’s the big one. That’s the biggest. And we want to thank all of the brave fighters. We want to thank these incredible people, the first responders, service members who are racing to the extreme peril really, their lives in extreme danger.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-receives-briefing-on-california-wildfires-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Receives Briefing on California Wildfires Transcript September 14","00:01"
"Donald Trump","Soon after the event, I’ll present the distinguished flying cross to seven military heroes who recently brave raging fire and suffocating smoke to save lives. So we have seven people that were recommended very strongly by your representatives, and we’re going to give them a very nice medal, very important medal. A US medal that’s very powerful, very important. So I know you like that. Together, we’ll keep the people safe. I want to thank the governor for the job he’s done. We’ve had great coordination, great relationship. I know we come from different sides of the planet, but we actually have a very good relationship. Good man. And governor, would you like to say something?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-receives-briefing-on-california-wildfires-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Receives Briefing on California Wildfires Transcript September 14","01:06"
"Governor Newsom","No. Well, it’s great to have you back here in the state, Mr. President, thank you for being here in particular with two of the coast guard aircrafts that we’re now bringing into the California family that have been retrofitted, these C130s. Just an example, another example of the partnership between the federal government and the state of California, that partnership of course extended with incredible collaborative spirit of FEMA. Pete has done an amazing job. He’s known by first name as Pete out here in state of California. Bob Fenton, his regional director. We’re joined by Tom Porter, the chief of Cal Fire, head of natural resources, Wade Crowfoot, pleased to have the Fresno County mayor here, Mayor Mins, and of course, supervisor from up north in Siskyou, that was kind enough to come all the way down.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-receives-briefing-on-california-wildfires-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Receives Briefing on California Wildfires Transcript September 14","01:45"
"Governor Newsom","We’ve got fires from Siskyou County, right up there at the border of Oregon, all the way down to the Mexican border. About a month ago, literally to the day, we began to have a series of 14,000 lightning strikes over three day period. 1100 fires have sparked in the last month, 2.8 million acres just in the last 30 days have burned. Unprecedented in California history, 3.2 million over the course of this calendar year. There’s over 16,500 firefighters currently out in the lines and I’m very pleased and I’m very grateful Mr. President, that you’re recognizing some of the other heroes, those national guard men and women that did an extraordinary job saving the lives of hundreds and hundreds of people stranded with some of these most intense fires.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-receives-briefing-on-california-wildfires-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Receives Briefing on California Wildfires Transcript September 14","02:30"
"Governor Newsom","You mentioned the August Complex, 789,000 acres. The largest in California history. We have a series of forest fires, but also brush fires and grass fires that we’re tackling. We’ve made great progress in the last few weeks, though tragically we’ve lost 24 lives so far to these battles, 4200 plus structures have been lost, and 44,000 people have evacuated. I want to thank you and acknowledge the work that you’ve done to be mediate in terms of your response to our FMAG requests 14. And we were just talking, Mark Ghilarducci is the head of the Office of Emergency Services, may be a record that the states received in the FMAG support, as well as the major disaster declaration, which you referenced on August 22nd, which was profoundly significant, not only to help us support our mutual aid system, but also individuals that are in desperate need of support.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-receives-briefing-on-california-wildfires-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Receives Briefing on California Wildfires Transcript September 14","03:17"
"Governor Newsom","We can agree to disagree, and I appreciate your frame on the politics of this, but let me just acknowledge two things briefly and I’ll turn it back to you. There’s no question when you look past this decade and looking past almost 1000 plus years that we have not done justice on our forest management. I don’t think anyone disputes that. I want to acknowledge, we have our US forest representative here, the state of California, your administration just entered into a first of its type commitment over the next 20 years to double our vegetation management and forest management. I want to thank you for supporting that effort, funding that effort. We acknowledge our role and responsibility to do more in that space. But one thing is fundamental, 57% of the land in this state is federal forest land. 3% is California. So we really do need that support.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-receives-briefing-on-california-wildfires-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Receives Briefing on California Wildfires Transcript September 14","04:11"
"Governor Newsom","We need that emphasis of engagement, and we are fully committed to working with you to advance that cause. And final point I’d be negligent, and this is not, and we’ve known each other too long. And as you suggest, the working relationship I value. We obviously feel very strongly that the hots are getting hotter. The dries are getting drier. When we’re having heat domes the likes of which we’ve never seen in our history, the hottest August ever in the history of the state, the ferocity, these fires, the drought five plus years, losing 163 million trees to that drought. Something’s happened to the plumbing of the world. And we come from a perspective, humbly, where we submit the science in and observed evidence is self evident. That climate change is real, and that is exacerbating this. And so I think there’s an area of at least commonality on vegetation, forest management, but please respect and I know you do, the difference of opinion… The difference of opinion out here as it relates to this fundamental issue on the issue of climate change.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-receives-briefing-on-california-wildfires-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Receives Briefing on California Wildfires Transcript September 14","05:05"

"Chad Wolf","Well, thank you Mr. President, for coming to Sacramento today and again, taking that decisive action that we heard the governor talk about and really pulling the full resources of the federal government here to California, as well as to other areas out here in the west. Let me just to reiterate the great partnership that we have between FEMA, the US forest service, Cal Fire, OES, the governor’s office. It’s really the partnership. It’s really a model that we have out here in California that we think is just fantastic. It’s getting a lot of support locally here very quickly. So I just wanted to reiterate that and say, thank you to our partners for what you do every day.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-receives-briefing-on-california-wildfires-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Receives Briefing on California Wildfires Transcript September 14","06:17"
"Chad Wolf","Let me just say they also do a great job on mutual aid. So they pull in a number of fire resources from outside of the state, as well as country, for that matter. We were talking earlier about some international partners that they have here. We’re happy to support that as well. And then let me just say, thanks as you did, Mr. President to the brave firefighters and all the first responders that are responding every day to the fires that we see here, those are the heroes of the day, and we’re just happy to be part of that process. Happy to support them with the resources through your office, Mr. President, and just really, again, look forward to the partnership we have here and continuing to push that along.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-receives-briefing-on-california-wildfires-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Receives Briefing on California Wildfires Transcript September 14","06:53"
"President Trump","Well, they’re doing a great job, and they really have over the years.

Pete Gaynor, please, FEMA.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-receives-briefing-on-california-wildfires-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Receives Briefing on California Wildfires Transcript September 14","00:27"
"Pete Gaynor","Sir, you’re going to hear this constantly about the partnership. I can’t say enough about the federal, the state, counties, tribes working together out here in California. From the Governor on down, it is a true team effort, and I know the major disaster decs and FMAGs have allowed the Governor’s team to exercise all the resources that the federal government has to respond and protect life, and that’s the number one priority.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-receives-briefing-on-california-wildfires-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Receives Briefing on California Wildfires Transcript September 14","00:34"
"Pete Gaynor","I know we’re going to be working on debris removal and then, lastly, protection of the watershed event follow-on disasters come the wet season. So together, I couldn’t be prouder to be part of this team in California.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-receives-briefing-on-california-wildfires-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Receives Briefing on California Wildfires Transcript September 14","01:03"

"Wade Crowfoot","Yeah. Well, from our perspective, there is an amazing partnership on the ground, and there needs to be. As the Governor said, we’ve had temperatures explode this summer. You may have learned that we broke a world record in the Death Valley, 130 degrees, but even in greater LA, 120-plus degrees, and we’re seeing this warming trend make our summers warmer, but also our winters warmer as well.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-receives-briefing-on-california-wildfires-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Receives Briefing on California Wildfires Transcript September 14","01:28"
"Wade Crowfoot","But I think one area of mutual agreement and priority is vegetation management. But I think we want to work with you to really recognize the changing climate and what it means to our forests and actually work together with that science, that science is going to be key, because if we ignore that science and put our head in the sand and think it’s all about vegetation management, we’re not going to succeed together protecting Californians.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-receives-briefing-on-california-wildfires-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Receives Briefing on California Wildfires Transcript September 14","01:50"

There is no way to do this [Inaudible 00:02:48] identified, but I wanted to approach the map because what this displays very simply is all of the green is federal lands.
