"President Trump","Working very hard with the CDC, with everybody on a subject that has become a very big subject. Our country is doing very well. Our professionals are doing really an incredible job. We’re also working with other countries to help them because they really have a fear of the unknown. We’re working very much with a lot of other countries including Columbia, but we’re working with a lot of other countries on helping them with respect to this problem. And again, we’re doing very well. Some additional people were reported.
