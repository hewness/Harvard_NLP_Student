"Donald Trump","Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Hello, Pennsylvania. Let’s go, Pennsylvania. We’ve got to do the same thing we did four years ago, and I have a feeling… Look at this, I have a feeling we’re going to do it. And hello, Butler. Butler, right? Three days from now, we are going to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and we are going to win four more years in our great and beautiful White House. With your support, we will continue to bring back your jobs, cut your taxes, cut regulations, and ensure more products are stamped, very proudly, with that wonderful term, Made in the USA. Nobody else talks about that. Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. You saw what happened the other day? They don’t like to report it. GDP 33.1, biggest in history. Biggest in history by far. Some people say it’s one of the biggest moments for our country economically. They don’t like to report it. There’s a lot of fake news out there. A lot of fake news.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-butler-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Butler, PA October 31","03:32"

"Donald Trump","Joe Biden will shut down your economy, ship your jobs to China, where they pay him a lot of money, raise your taxes $4 trillion, and send your state into a deep and catastrophic depression. That’s what’s going to happen. He’s going to raise your taxes. He’s the only man I’ve ever seen, he campaigns, “We will raise your taxes.” All my life I’ve seen guys… You study politics, and you say, “I’ve never seen anyone say, ‘We’re going to raise your taxes.'” That’s his primary theme, “We’re going to raise your taxes,” and “We’ll end fracking,” that was the other thing. Remember?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-butler-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Butler, PA October 31","05:15"
"Donald Trump","He’d said it for a year, and then he came to Pennsylvania. They said, “We have a million jobs.” “Oh, okay, well, we’ll leave fracking.” But the people won’t let him. His bosses won’t let him. Biden has vowed to abolish the entire US oil industry. No fracking, no mining, no natural gas, no heating in the winter, no air conditioning in the summer, no electricity during peak hours. And gas prices, you like that $2 gas, right? How about $5, $6 and $7? “Darling, let’s sell the car. It’s a little bit too large. Let’s get a compact.” Biden’s plan is an economic death sentence for Pennsylvania. He will outlaw fracking and eradicate your great economy. You had the greatest year you’ve ever had last year. And now next year, you’re going to have the best. If this happens with the taxes and with the fracking, you’re going to have a real problem in Pennsylvania.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-butler-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Butler, PA October 31","05:50"
"Donald Trump","Kamala, Kamala Harris. You have to pronounce her name exactly right, or she gets very upset with you. Although our great vice president beat her very badly in that debate, wouldn’t you say? Very badly. By far the most liberal senator in the US Senate. In fact, Bernie Sanders is like a conservative by comparison. She even sponsored the Green New Deal. That’s another beauty, the Green New Deal. But I have great news for Pennsylvania. So this has just happened. This is like breaking news. Are you ready for breaking news? Because we have to protect you. Are you ready? Moments ago, I signed an order to protect Pennsylvania fracking and block any effort to undermine energy production in your state. So in other words, if one of these maniacs come along and they say, “We’re going to end fracking, we’re going to destroy the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,” you can say, “Sorry about that. You have just…” I signed it on that beautiful Marine One. Did you see that?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-butler-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Butler, PA October 31","06:46"
"Donald Trump","I said, “Go right over them.” Did you see it go right over you? Whoa. It’s a good way to arrive, right? No, I just signed it on the helicopter, I just signed it, and I’m very honored to have done it. So we’re protected. So now if they say, “We’re going to do this or that,” let’s just say they’re going to have a long fight. Pennsylvania oil and natural gas in the Marcellus Shale contributes $45 billion to your local economy. I’d say 45 billion’s a lot. No, but he said if… oh, so for, what, a year, right? He’s on the stage with the super liberals. They had like 27 of them. We only had 17 running for the Republican. You remember? 17 plus one. I was the one. And they said, “No, he doesn’t really want it. He just wants to have a good time.” No. And by the way, do you consider this a good time, okay? Okay, let me ask you, is there a better place to be anytime, anywhere than a Trump rally, right? We’re having a good time. We have a good time.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-butler-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Butler, PA October 31","08:07"
"Donald Trump","You know why I have a good time? Because no president, no administration has done more in the first three and a half years with tax cuts and regulation cuts and rebuilding our military and helping our vets and all of the things we’ve done. And therefore I have a good time, but we’re fighting a very nasty deep state. And if we win, and we’re going to, I… I don’t know if you see what’s going on. Florida, ooh, it’s looking very good. They’re very concerned. They’re saying, “What’s going on in Florida?” We love Florida. We’re getting a lot of votes down there. This isn’t based on polling, polling where they say, “Let’s see, what are we going to give him today? Let’s put him down like 30. What are we going to do? Suppression. Let’s do a…” No, no, the votes are actually coming in. We’re looking very good in a place called Pennsylvania, but don’t tell everybody. Don’t tell everybody.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-butler-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Butler, PA October 31","09:07"
"Donald Trump","Right, Mike? Have you seen? Our great Congressman. Mike, have you seen? Very good, very good numbers. Very, very good numbers, incredible. But when you have crowds like this, and, honestly, this is my third stop. Can you believe? I have a fourth one. I have a fourth one. Other guys, they go home, “Darling, what are we having for dinner?” I say, “I got to speak in front of another 25,000 tonight.” It’s all right. That’s all right. We got to do what we got to do. We got to get the job done. Just make sure you get out and vote. But Pennsylvania oil and natural gas supports nearly 1 million Pennsylvania jobs. So when Sleepy Joe heard that, he said, “Yeah, of course I like fracking.” But it’s not going to happen. It won’t happen. It’s not real. And it’s one of the state’s top exports, that’s what it is. Energy is your top, or one of your top exports. This is the biggest thing you do.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-butler-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Butler, PA October 31","10:05"
"Donald Trump","If Joe Biden is elected, he will cancel our… And you know that, he’s going to terminate, frankly, a better word, terminate your energy industry and every job because they want to go to wind. They want to go… They don’t even want wind. Honestly, I don’t think they want energy period, close down every factory. I don’t think they want anything. I don’t think they have any idea what they want. I know Joe doesn’t. For a fact, he doesn’t. He has no clue. He is totally shot, okay? You see the new sunglasses, the aviator glasses, right? They should be a little bit larger, covers up those new eyes. A vote for Biden and Harris is a vote to ban fracking, ban mining, and completely destroy Pennsylvania. Otherwise, he’s not bad. A vote for me is a vote to remain energy independent and build the strongest economy in the history or your state and of your country. And our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever recorded. That was the 33.1% that the fake news doesn’t want to talk about. Think of that, faster than any nation in the world.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-butler-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Butler, PA October 31","11:02"
"Donald Trump","In the past five months, we’ve created a record 11.4 million American jobs. That’s a… Nobody’s… We’ve never done that. We’ve never done it. You know what? We’ve built such a strong foundation, we had the greatest economy in the history of our country, and we had the plague. We had the plague come in from China, and we had to close it up for a little while. And we closed it up, and then… But the foundation was so strong. And that’s why, I don’t know if you saw auto production, housing production, the numbers are through the roof. Many of the numbers are bigger and better. Did you know this, Mike Kelly? The numbers are bigger and better than they were before the plague came in. Okay? It’s pretty amazing, right? It’s pretty amazing. That’s because the foundation… If we didn’t have the foundation, it would be just the opposite. We would’ve been in big trouble. And again, faster than any other nation. While foreign nations are in a total free fall, we’re creating the world’s greatest economic powerhouse. And that’s what we’re doing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-butler-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Butler, PA October 31","12:18"
"Donald Trump","We’re going to have a greater year next year. I mean, unless somebody comes in and quadruples your taxes, “We’re going to raise taxes.” A recent Gallup poll, this is amazing, just came out, found that 56% of Americans say they’re better off today than they were four years ago under the Obama-Biden administration. And in all fairness, that’s during a pandemic, and we’re rounding the corner of the pandemic, but that’s during a pandemic, think of that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-butler-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Butler, PA October 31","13:19"

Biden is a Washington vulture who decimated your steel mills, annihilated your coal jobs, that’s for sure. And supported every disastrous sellout trade deal for a half a century.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-butler-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Butler, PA October 31","16:00"
"Donald Trump","Biden was a cheerleader for NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever made. And for China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, where they are considered at a level where they get all the advantages. We don’t get the advantages. They’re considered a developing nation. I said, “No, no, you’re not going to be a developing nation. We’re a developing nation.” Because if you’re a developing nation, you get all of the advantages. And we were treated very badly. And we said, “Look, we’re going to have to talk about this.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-butler-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Butler, PA October 31","16:53"
"Donald Trump","We pulled out of the World Health Organization. You know why? No. So we have 325 million people. China has 1.5 billion people. Right. We paid $500 million a year. They paid $39 million a year. In addition to that, they had guys, and for this I give them credit, but they had guys that practically ran the place. Right. So they’re paying 39 and we’re paying 500. And we have a smaller population, but we have a stronger economy and we were beating them. For the last 10 years, anybody in business, you heard 2019 China will surpass the United States in the economy. That China was going to be a bigger economy than… 2019, 2019. And then I came along and we were skyrocketing way, way above. They would’ve never caught us. They would have never caught us. Then we got hit with a plague, but now we’re bringing it back into… I talked about a V and the fake news said it won’t happen.
