"John","Mr. President, I was actually speaking to the governor of Iowa before she came to see you. There’s a backlog in terms of live animals, hogs and beef on the hoof out there. How soon will it be before that can get processed? And we are seeing some shortages in meats in many places across the country. How long will it be before the supply chain gets ramped back up again so that we don’t have any shortages?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-transcript","Donald Trump Meeting with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds Transcript","00:19"
"Donald Trump","Plenty of supply. Go ahead.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-transcript","Donald Trump Meeting with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds Transcript","00:41"
"Kim Reynolds","Yeah, I think so. We’re moving in that direction. As the secretary said, you’ve got to think South Dakota’s coming back on board. We’ll have most of our facilities up and going, so as we continue to keep them up and processing and bring more back online and continue to exceed the capacity, we’re going to hopefully prevent what could have been a really sorry situation where we were euthanizing some of our protein supply and really impacting the food supply, not only across the country, but throughout the world. So this is critical infrastructure, it’s an essential workforce, and the team and the effort and the executive order, I think, has really maybe prevented what could have been a really serious situation. I think, Secretary, would you agree with that? We’re still monitoring it. We’ve turned a corner.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-transcript","Donald Trump Meeting with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds Transcript","00:42"
"Sonny Perdue","I think we turned the corner. We see these plants coming back online. Obviously because of some infected employees, they won’t be full forced for a while, but we think the storage, you’ll see more variety and more meat cases fully supplied.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-transcript","Donald Trump Meeting with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds Transcript","01:29"

"Mike Pence","Mr. President, what the governor’s made clear is it was because the president used the Defense Production Act. Make it clear that our objective is to keep meat processing plants open, whether it be an Iowa, whether it be in Delaware, whether it be in Colorado, and working through the Department of Agriculture, deploying CDC personnel to these meat processing plants, we’re doing that. I think, Mr. President, one of the … and you talk to a great heartland governor like Governor Kim Reynolds, one of the great stories of the coronavirus outbreak has been that our food supply has continued to work every day, from the field to the fork, to the grocers to the meat processors. Thanks to the president’s decision to use the Defense Production Act, we now have uniformity, and the objective is to work every day to keep those meat processing plants open, and the ones that were coming down are going back online.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-transcript","Donald Trump Meeting with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds Transcript","01:53"

"Kim Reynolds","It’s in tandem we’ve done that, so with the testing, with the PPE, with the restructuring in the facilities, they’re also doing a lot of that as to try to social distance where they can, to put in shields where they can, to look at the lines to separate the shifts, so it really is a partnership, really.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-transcript","Donald Trump Meeting with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds Transcript","02:50"
"Donald Trump","Kim, I think we had a great talk with the owners of the plants, the top people, big people. These are big companies, actually. You wouldn’t believe how many plants they have, and I think it was a very strong talk, and I think they got the message. So within a week and a half, we should be in great shape, maybe sooner.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-transcript","Donald Trump Meeting with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds Transcript","03:07"
"John","Another piece of it is as the price for animals and the hoof has gone down, the price of boxed beef has really skyrocketed, and there’s a huge price differential disparity there. Farmers are really hurting, whereas these meat packing plants are making a lot of money. Is there something that the federal government can do? Farmers are asking.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-transcript","Donald Trump Meeting with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds Transcript","03:24"

"Speaker 7","Are enough steps being taken to protect the health and safety of these workers? The advocates for these workers say they’re not being protected.

That’s extraordinary.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-transcript","Donald Trump Meeting with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds Transcript","04:18"
"Mike Pence","What we’ve looked at into these plants is when we have an outbreak, the CDC deploys a team on the ground. We also worked with the governor and other governors around the country to deploy personal protective equipment to allow the workforce to safely return once testing is done. In most of these meat processing plants, we ended up testing everyone in the facility, and the people that are healthy are able to return with new countermeasures and new protection, new face masks or gloves as the case may be. We’re also working with the companies to put new con countermeasures into place, but as the secretary said, our objective is to equal goals. Number one is the safety and health of the workforce in our meat processing plants and to ensure the strength of the food supply by getting people back to work and keeping the plants open.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-transcript","Donald Trump Meeting with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds Transcript","04:32"

"Kim Reynolds","Yeah, no, I would completely agree with that. As I said, I was on a call with most of them yesterday. Thank you for the conference call that you did I think this week, last week with our producers and governors across the country specifically addressing this processing issue, so I appreciate that very much, Mr. Vice President. I just asked if they were having any trouble getting to PPE. No, they were fine. We are seeing the supply chain open up. Appreciate what the administration has done to make sure that they have the adequate PPE to protect their employees. This is their teammates. This is an essential workforce. They know how important it is to take care of workforce, and a big part of it was providing them the confidence to go back into the facility knowing that they either tested positive and they’d recovered, or they were on a shift with other employees that had tested negative, and we’ll continue to work with them.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-transcript","Donald Trump Meeting with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds Transcript","05:21"
"Kim Reynolds","We’ve made it very clear if they want to do additional testing, we’ll be happy to do that, but they are testing them before they even enter the plant. They’re doing a temperature scan. They’re doing an assessment. They have to have the mask on when they enter the facility. Many times they have the mask and the face shield. They’re doing social distancing. They’re relaxing their attendance policy.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-transcript","Donald Trump Meeting with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds Transcript","06:10"

"Kim Reynolds","And they feel better, yeah. So it’s a partnership. We’re all working together to make sure that we’re providing them the confidence of a safe environment, but at the same time, we’re making sure that the food supply chain is moving and that the country is being fed and we’re continuing [crosstalk 00:06:46].","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-transcript","Donald Trump Meeting with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds Transcript","06:29"

"Kim Reynolds","So they are. It’s a fairly close working arrangement, so they are trying to separate, I think, with some additional space between the workforce. I know it’s some of the things that they’re looking at, but they do where they can.

Very bad shape, and we’re sending them quite a few, so we’re in a position where we can now help other people because basically, what are you talking about? You’re talking about people dying. It’s not a question of countries. You’re talking about a lot of people are dying, and we make a great ventilator, as you people found out.

"Donald Trump","So we’re working on that, and in a certain way, I like them to be donations. I really do. I think it’s goodwill. It’s hard to say, “You have to pay us in order to save people from dying.” I’m the first one to say you’ve got to pay, but this is something that’s a little bit different. I think it’s something they really appreciate more than normally, like you’re doing some trade for some linen or whatever it is. A ventilator will save lives, and some of these countries have none.

I wasn’t involved in that, but I think they helped us a lot.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-transcript","Donald Trump Meeting with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds Transcript","15:08"
"Donald Trump","To them, they can look at a ventilator, and it’s a very simple machine. Somebody else looks at it, they have no clue. I think they did an incredible job. Now, I don’t know anything about any of the details of it, but it was a well-oiled machine. They were able to get things that nobody else was able to get. They got good pricing. Pricing by the way, was not the most important element, but pricing is pricing. But we were able to get gowns and gloves and masks and all these things at a very early point. Now we’re making a lot of it. You saw it yesterday where we’re making masks at Honeywell, but I will say, Deborah, you saw it too, the level of ramp up that we did so quickly, so I would say they did. I wasn’t involved in the details, but I can tell you it started flowing with the planes pouring in all from all over the place.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-transcript","Donald Trump Meeting with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds Transcript","15:36"
"Speaker 12","Did the program in any way favor suppliers who had political connections?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-transcript","Donald Trump Meeting with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds Transcript","16:31"
"Donald Trump","Well, I don’t even know that, because I have no idea who bought. I wasn’t involved in that. We have a lot of support in our campaign. A lot of people are supporting our campaign. They want to see us win very badly, so I don’t know. Do they have companies? Do they not have companies? I can tell you I don’t believe these kids would have any knowledge of any of these companies. Like, I had seen this Dr. Bright. I never met Dr. Bright. I don’t know who he is. I didn’t hear good things about him. I did not hear good things about him at all, and to me he seems like a disgruntled employee that’s trying to help the democrats win an election by getting out.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-transcript","Donald Trump Meeting with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds Transcript","16:35"
"Donald Trump","I mean, he’s got a pre-taped sermon about what he thinks and I can tell you they didn’t think he did a very particularly good job, as I understand it. Now, I just got this this morning because I’m saying, “Who is this guy?” But I never met him. I know nothing about him, but he’s a disgruntled guy, and I don’t think disgruntled people should be working for a certain administration. I mean, he certainly seemed to have a very well-packaged deal, and he’s got the same lawyers that some other well known people had, and he comes up with the whistleblower. I always thought whistleblower was sort of a secret thing. Well, everyone knows who he is, so why is it a whistleblower?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-transcript","Donald Trump Meeting with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds Transcript","17:14"

"Donald Trump","Well, protection from what? Protection from what? but everybody knows who he is because he was very public about it, and if you look at his lawyers, his lawyers are the same lawyers that other people have used, so I don’t know much about it, but to me he seems like a disgruntled employee.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-transcript","Donald Trump Meeting with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds Transcript","17:58"

"Donald Trump","Well, I think it is what it is. You saying it’s 70,000. It’s approximately now 70,000, so do I believe them? Yeah.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-transcript","Donald Trump Meeting with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds Transcript","18:27"

"Donald Trump","I don’t believe them from China, and I don’t believe I’m from other countries where I see a very tiny number of people died, but you’re watching the news and you see what’s going on. But our numbers are essentially certified numbers. They’re individual hospitals. They’re putting out the numbers. I don’t imagine there’d be a very big variation. No, it’s a big number, but it’s also a number that’s at the lower scale. I think, Deborah, you could say it’s at the very lower scale of any number that was predicted, because if you look at the predictions, I guess they said from 100,000 to 220,000. That’s if we did the big shut-ins and if we went to the total shutdown, and now it’s time to open up our country. We’ve got to open up our country. Okay. Thank you very much, everybody.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-meeting-with-iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-transcript","Donald Trump Meeting with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds Transcript","18:35"
