"Donald Trump","You’re setting records at the border. You’ve been unbelievable. And I know the wall is helping. In two weeks we will have hit 300 miles of wall and this is a small version of it because actually the real deal goes up 30 feet. This is much smaller than that. If this is a small version of i this is what the finish will be. Those are anti-climb plates at top. So that makes it much more difficult when you get to the top, because you see these guys climbing up with drugs on their back. And when you see that they look at the wall and they say, “Let’s pass, let’s take a pass on it.” So it’s been a really incredible success. So within two weeks we’ll be in 300, general I think in 300 miles.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","00:00"
"Speaker 1","So we’re actually going faster than that. We’d like to think we didn’t get the 300 by the end of this week.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","00:45"

"Speaker 1","Yes sir.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","00:50"
"Donald Trump","And we’re doing about how many a week? About 10 miles a week.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","00:52"
"Speaker 1","Over 10 miles a week, over two miles a day.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","00:54"
"Donald Trump","That’s fantastic. That’s fantastic. So it’s a great feeling to have closed up the border. Now people come in if they come in through Meredith, they come in legally. But they don’t come in like they used to. And human trafficking I think went down 96% or something. It’s been incredible. Mark, why don’t you say a few words please.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","00:56"
"Mark","Yes, sir. So thank you. So first of all what you see behind me has saved American lives. Every single bit of concrete and steel that goes into the ground, the operational capacity of the men, women that you’re seeing right here goes exponentially higher to stop dangerous things and people from coming into this country. Drugs [inaudible 00:01:40] us, shape the behavior of the cartels.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","01:17"
"Mark","It puts us in an offensive position just like the president said. Because of that this year to date we’ve seized over a million pounds of drugs. Think about that. This year to date a million pounds of drugs and this wall is helping shape the behavior so that we can get better at doing that. We talk about criminals, we apprehend thousands of criminals every single year. Think about that. A lot of these individuals, violent criminals because of this wall we’re able to apprehend and stop these criminals from coming to this country. [inaudible 00:02:14] other offenses, we have fewer victims of United States citizens because of the wall, because of what this president has provided us.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","01:45"
"Mark","Let’s talk about gangs. Every single year we stop hundreds and hundreds of gangs from pouring into this country like MS- 13, whose motto is rape, kill and control. That’s their motto, rape, kill and control. Just recently wasn’t that long ago they used machetes to hack up their victim and they actually leave them decapitated. That’s what we’re talking about when we’re talking about what this tool provides us. And then of course illegal immigration. Even during the height of a global pandemic illegal immigration continues. And they allow themselves to be put in stash houses that are unsanitary, unsafe. They’re put in a tractor trailers for days. I mean it’s like a COVID Petri dish, but yet they’re coming across. But because of the tools that we have like this wall, we’re able to stop the individual that have COVID to protect our citizen of this country. And Mr. President, I can say I’ve been a law enforcement for over 30 years, my entire adult life. And I want to personally thank you. You absolutely understand the threats that we face along our borders.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","02:23"
"Mark","You understand that border security is national security and what today represents is a tremendous achievement that shows our commitment and the president’s commitment to do what he said he was going to do from the beginning. And that’s everything that we can to give these men and women the tools that they need to safeguard the health, safety and security of the American people. So on behalf of the customs and border protection Mr. President, I want to say thank you for your continued commitment.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","03:29"
"Donald Trump","Done a great job. You’ve done a great job Mark, I’m impressed. You’ve been my friend and you’ve been with us from very early on and we appreciate it. We’ve made a lot of progress. You don’t hear about the wall anymore because we won. When you win if you’re us you never hear about it again. And we have page after page of achievement that you never hear of anymore. That people say, Oh, let’s not talk about space force, let’s not talk about all of the things we’ve done. But the wall is something that probably was the most visible of all. And it’s working so incredibly. 280 miles a little more than that. And again, that’ll be great whether it’s next week or the week after knowing the general will do it next week, but we’ll be at that 300 mile mark. And the difference is like day and night. Number one, you can use a lot less people so you can be doing other things, which is great because once you have the wall nobody gets through it. Additionally, the wall is equipped with various things. It’s set up the cameras and all sorts of elements. You control a lot of things even from the air or within the wall. Interestingly if you look this is steel the exterior, but inside the steel is hardened concrete. Very, very strong, heavy strength concrete. And inside the concrete is rebar. So you have steel, you have concrete, you have rebar, you have all different materials.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","04:00"
"Donald Trump","So it’s very, very hard to get through. Very, very hard. And it made it actually much stronger than it would be even if it were steel. So inside concrete, inside that what’s called grade A hard rebar, which is very hard to saw. You can’t do it very easily. But I think it’s going to be fantastic. And again, the big thing is that plate that’s a big deal. We had people that couldn’t get over that. That was the thing that stopped them. They could get up to the plate, but once they got there there was nothing to grab. So it’s called anti-climb, it’s been great. General would you like to say something?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","05:24"
"Speaker 1","I wouldn’t sir, and I think the amazing thing about this is it’s part of a great team here. We enjoy working for DHS. Commissioner Morgan and his people and the agent standing next to you here are heroes. They’re the ones we work with every single day. The Corps of engineers again, we stay in concrete and steel but our employees out in the army Corps of engineers are very, very dedicated to be able to make sure we can get this done. We’ve talked about the 300 mile mark, but what you might not know is that this administration has basically funded us for 733 miles. 300 are going in or I mean already in right now basically, there’s another 300 that are being built right now in every all our other places across these four states. 49 different projects are all going in the ground. And in the last 133 are in design and acquisition. We’re writing the contracts, we’re designing it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","06:02"
"Speaker 1","But that’s 733 miles that are paid for to be able to continue to execute. [inaudible 00:06:56] Mr. President is that we want to continue to go out of our way to try to make sure we’re taking care of the environment and mitigate any damages out there. We’re also worried about the native American tribes. We’re worried about landowners. We want to do this the best way we can to achieve this objective. And we’re just very, very proud and honored to be a part of this overall great team.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","06:51"
"Donald Trump","Great job. Fantastic job. As you know we have some natural walls so to speak. We have mountain areas. We have very, very rough areas that are virtually impossible to get by. We have the river itself. We have a river that’s a rough river, a dangerous river. And you don’t need walls at certain locations, but we have covered it. And this is something that’s very special, very important. And I looked at the platform, I didn’t see it but I know they used to talk about it that they would take down the wall if they got in, they would take it down. And one of the incredible things in terms Mark of timing, is that because of the coronavirus or whatever you want to call it, the China plague. Call it whatever you want, China plague is more accurate. But because of what happened with this Mexico’s heavily infected.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","07:16"
"Donald Trump","Because of what happened with this, Mexico is heavily infected and it’s stopping people from coming across. We put up 18 miles in San Diego as an example, right? Opposite Tijuana, and Tijuana is probably the worst place in South America in terms of the China virus. I think it is the worst place. And San Diego is not suffering at all because of it. I mean, it’s an incredible thing that happened. So California is actually very happy that we built the wall. They don’t say it publicly because they can’t. It’s not good politically for them. Although I actually think it probably is good politically for them. So it’s been an incredible success. Chad, do you want to say a couple of words?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","08:03"
"Chad","Absolutely. Let me again, thank you for your leadership, Mr. President, on providing the resources to build over 450 miles of the new border wall system by the end of this calendar year.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","08:40"
"Chad","Never did we ever dream of that at the beginning of this administration. So thank you for that. Let me also say a lot of the procedures that we are putting in place today are having a real impact on applying a consequence to those that are entering the country illegally. Those that are coming into the country without any legal right to be here. We put enough procedures in place that we are returning 90% of those individuals within 120 minutes today. That’s a big accomplishment. And then let me just end by thanking you for your support for the men and women of law enforcement. DHS is the largest law enforcement agency in the country. We have over 60,000 law enforcement officers and the dangerous push in policies that we see today talking about defunding law enforcement and defunding police are irresponsible. So I want to thank you for your support for the men and women of law enforcement, men and women that are standing to your left. Thank you for that as well. And we’ll continue to do the mission of the department today despite the types of criticisms that we receive.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","08:50"
"Donald Trump","Well, a lot of people, even the media frankly, I mean, they see what’s happening. They see the numbers and there hasn’t been very much criticism amazingly. Would anybody have anything to say to the … We call it the fake news media but we don’t want to say that. You have anything to say? Any statements to make or questions to ask of them?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","09:49"

"Speaker 2","This is on behalf of the men and women of CBP and all the law enforcement across the country. Thank you for your support. I’ve been doing this job for 29 years and I can tell you that it makes a world of difference knowing that we have to top cover from our commissioners and certainly from the administration. And I want to tell you that the infrastructure that we’re putting into place, whether it’s a technology, whether it’s the wall system, or the men and women that we’re adding to our workforce each and every day, it’s certainly going to help improve the security in our country. And so on behalf of all of us that each day put on our uniform, leave our families, hoping to make a difference, we appreciate your support. Thank you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","10:15"

"Speaker 4","Secretary [inaudible 00:11:06] Miles Taylor said that the White House liaison for DHS has been asked to dig up dirt on him. Is that true?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","11:06"
"Chad","I don’t know anything about that. What I can tell you is I’m very disappointed in Mr. Taylor. He was at the department for a number of years, but again, decided to left the department over a year ago, year and a half ago, left the department, very praising the administration’s policies procedures. Has said nothing since that time in 70 days, roughly 70 days from election, has decided now to start talking. I think most reasonable Americans understand what that is all about. So very disappointed.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","11:13"
"Donald Trump","And if I could add, I never met him to the best of my knowledge. I never heard of him. I don’t know who he is. I then said, when did he leave? And it was like a year and a half ago. He said the best things about what we’re doing, unbelievable segments. And he left a year and a half ago. All of a sudden he’s bad mouthing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","11:45"
"Donald Trump","Now the reason is the Democrats or somebody got to him and said, how would you like to speak or whatever. He’s a lowlife. Anybody that does that is a low life to me. And it’s a shame because these people work so hard. And I don’t even know if you know, Miles Taylor.

"Donald Trump","I never met him. I never heard of him before. But all of a sudden they have big headlines. Member of the Trump administration. He’s got a Trump administration and he’s been gone for close to a year and a half. And I guess you met him or knew him a little bit, but he left. And we checked, said the greatest things. And all of a sudden, he says, man, right before an election, these are bad people. These are sick people. And we call it out. The difference is we call it out. Somebody else would let him get away with it. We call him out. He’s a lowlife. Okay.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","12:19"
"Speaker 6","Do you have an update on the Post Office situation?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","12:52"
"Donald Trump","Yeah. The Post Office is running as well as it has in a long time. They took a lot of old admin [inaudible 00:13:01] where they wanted to do from past administrations and they’ve done them. Look, I have a much better idea of the Post Office. You raise the price per package by a number that it should be so that instead of Amazon and these other companies making a fortune, including the fact that they pay virtually no tax, which is ridiculous and very unfair to regular stores, Amazon will pay for the cost of the post office. So now instead of losing tens of billions of dollars a year like it has been for 30, 40 years, Amazon should pay for it. And so should other companies in the business of Amazon delivery. They should pay. They should also pay tax by the way. And then you’ll solve your problem with the Post Office, because I don’t want to lay people off.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","12:54"
"Donald Trump","I’m not laying postal workers off. And let me just tell you. What we do is it’s price per package. They haven’t figured exactly. Whether it’s $2 or $3 and you make it so Amazon has to pay and they can’t pass it on. They make a lot of money. They can’t pass it on to their customer. Right now, Amazon comes in, they build their big plant and they deliver the easy ones and the hard ones they give to the Post Office. And the plant is usually right next to a big Post Office building or a Post Office. They dump packages into the Post Office. We, the United States, delivers the package for Amazon and we lose a lot of money. Unacceptable. And I’ve been telling these people to do this for the last three years, but they just got the board and we’re going to be doing it. Amazon is going to pay for the Post Office.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","13:47"
"Speaker 6","Do you have any role in the decision not to make any changes to the postal service with overtime?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","14:39"
"Donald Trump","No [crosstalk 00:14:45]. You have a good man and the head man. And he was carrying on for years what has been taking place at … Mark, is that a correct statement?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","14:45"
"Mark","That is correct.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","14:52"
"Donald Trump","This has been going on for a long time. But I have a much better idea. You get more per package because the people that used to be there under the Obama administration appointed by Obama, they never went … Really, they never raised the prices on Amazon. So Amazon’s paying an ancient price and they shouldn’t be, and they shouldn’t be allowed to pass it on to their customer. They have to pay for it themselves. They make a fortune. So they’ve used the Post Office and they’ve used it very smartly, very well, and I’ve known this for a period of time, but now you have a full board. And we should raise the price of packages, Amazon has to pay, and we shouldn’t get rid of any of our postal workers. I don’t want to get rid of our postal workers.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","14:53"
"Donald Trump","If you look at past administrations, they wanted to cut the Post Office way down. I don’t want to do that. And by the way, Amazon could never replicate the Post Office. The Post Office is bigger than Amazon by a lot. Hard to believe how big it is. But it also loses billions and billions. Lost $78 billion over a short period, like a 12 year period of time. Something like that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","15:41"
"Donald Trump","… short period, like a 12 year period of time, something like that. 78 billion. Now, we’ll fix it very easily. It can be done in one day. We charge Amazon for years because it’s part of their model. They think the post office is stupid. They think the people in government is stupid. So he builds plants, he builds his receptor plant or whatever he may call it, or they may call it, and he takes a lot of that stuff and he drops it into the post office. Then the post office loses two and a half dollars every time they deliver a package. They shouldn’t do that. So my idea is very simple. Amazon has to pay, they can’t pass it on to their [inaudible 00:16:41]. Because they shouldn’t. They make so much money. They’ve made money by using the US post office. And nobody did anything about it. I did because we started this project three years ago. And [inaudible 00:16:55] to do it. So that’s what they should be doing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","16:03"
"Donald Trump","This is where you keep everything. Your post office could almost probably make money, probably ends up making money, first time in 45 years that it would actually make money. And I don’t want to fire anybody in the postal service. All right? I think that’s pretty clear. Yeah.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","16:58"

What was in a report done by some politicians on the other side, like water, what was in the report, that I don’t know.

"Donald Trump","And by the way, if sleepy Joe Biden ever got in, China would own the United States. They’d own it. They’d own every one of these people, they’d own this building, they’d own the United States because Biden would give them everything. For two reasons. Number one, he’s not smart. And number two, he’s weak. China would own our country. And you know what else? You’ll have a deal in the first month or sooner with Iran. Iran is dying to make a deal. But I said, “Let’s wait until after the election.” And they would want to wait because there’s a chance if Biden ever got in, they’d give them another 150 billion like they did. The dumbest deal I’ve ever seen.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","19:39"

The vaccine is great, therapeutics, and we’re very close to coming up with the answers. We’ve already, I think, have answers, know the truth. Then we have to, General, we have to deliver it.

"Donald Trump","I don’t even know who you’re talking about. I know that Ukraine sent a phony document saying it was a manifold document and it was a forged document. The black book, they call it a black book. And it turned out, I believe, to be forged. But I wouldn’t know what you’re talking about. I can only tell you this. They said Donald Trump knew nothing about anything. And that came out loud and clear. You could find a couple of sentences inside that say something. I don’t know. But I can say this. That black book that had to do with somebody that worked for me for a very short period of time, I think he’s a good man, you want to know the truth. But I don’t know. But I will say that the book, I think, they said was forged. It was a phony book. Just like everything else was phony with that whole deal. Look, we caught the Obama administration spying on our campaign. They spied on our campaign. That’s treason. That’s treason.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-august-18-border-wall-update","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript August 18: Border Wall Update","21:47"
"Donald Trump","If this were the other way around and it was Democrats instead of Republicans, many people would be in jail already. It’s a disgrace that it’s taking this long. We caught them spying on our campaign. Let’s see what happens. Just last week, I guess they announced last week that a very high level person from the FBI was forging documents in order to make me look bad. All right? It’s all about making me look bad. So he was a high level man, he was forging documents. Let’s see what happens to him. But the bottom line is we caught President Obama and sleepy Joe spying on our campaign. That’s treason, that’s illegal. These people should take them and do something with them. I’ll tell you. It’s a disgrace. It’s really a disgrace. And they knew it. And not only spying, they were working on our campaign before I won and after I won. Hence the insurance policy from Strzok and his lover, Page. Two lovers.

I’m very happy to have given a full and complete pardon to Susan B. Anthony. That was a great thing. That was very popular, too. That was a very good one. And I actually asked the other day, I said … They were talking about Susan B. Anthony, and she did that for other people and she didn’t want herself included. She wasn’t included in the pardon from many years ago. And I said, “Well, so she has a record?” And they said, “Yeah, she has a record.” I said, “Why can’t we pardon her?” They said, “That’s the coolest idea I’ve ever heard.” And it’s been very, very popular.
