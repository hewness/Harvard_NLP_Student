"Bernie Sanders","I know because people like me helped stop that. Although I would say to the American people go to YouTube, it’s all over the place. Joe said it many, many times.

"Donald Trump","The whole thing is crazy. Is that crazy? Is that craziest race? There’s that craziest race. Our country cannot be put in that position.

"Donald Trump","We cannot be put in that position, so you got to do what’s right. Because one thing we know President Xi of China is not like that. President Putin of Russia. There’s nobody been tougher than Russia. Nobody had been tougher than me to Russia. They want me to lose so badly. He’s not like that. Kim Jong Un. Remember, we’re going to be in a war with North Korea. What happened? What happened to the war? Kim Jong Un not like that. They’re top of the game. And most of the leaders, top of the game. We can’t have that. We can say, hey Xi, that’s wonderful.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","27:23"
"Donald Trump","But we can’t have that. We can’t have that. We have too much potential. We’re going to have the greatest year ever next year. We had the greatest year we’ve ever had. We had to stop it. We learned about the disease. We saved two million lives. Remember, it was going to be 2.2 million people were going to die. That was the model. We saved two million lives. And now we understand we protect our seniors, but we can’t have that. In 2016, Michigan voted. That’s a lot of people. Look at it as far as. I’m hearing the sound. It sounds like it’s from 20 miles away.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","27:56"
"Donald Trump","It almost is. Thank you. Thank you. In 2016, Michigan voted to fire this corrupt political establishment and you elected an outsider as president who is finally putting America first. We’re putting it first. And a lot of times, because I’d become friendly with many of the presidents and prime ministers, kings and queens, dictators, I must tell you, dictators. But I’ve become friendly with a lot of them. And they say two things, it’s incredible what you’ve done with the economy. They always say that. They always say it, no matter what.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","28:38"
"Donald Trump","They say we have done the most incredible job and they always start off by congratulating me. The next question is they want to buy our military equipment because we make the best equipment anywhere in the world. And sadly, with many of these nations who are not that friendly, we have to say no. Does that make sense? Does that make sense? Anyway, I don’t sound like a politician because I’m not a politician. I never wanted to be a politician. I became a politician for one very specific reason because we’re doing a job in the history of our country in the first three and a half years, nobody has done what we, what we, and this administration has been able to do with regulations, with taxes, with rebuilding our military, with strengthening our borders.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","29:19"
"Donald Trump","By the way, our border, the strongest it’s ever been. We’re building 10 miles a week. The wall is almost finished. They don’t want to talk about the wall. Remember that’s all they talked about was the wall. The wall is never going to get built. It’s never going to get built. Then I got it built. That’s almost completed. They don’t want to talk about it. And Mexico is paying for the wall. Remember that please. If I don’t always play by the rules of Washington and the Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you and I fight harder than any president has ever fought before.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","30:09"
"Donald Trump","One of the biggest issues for Michigan, as you know, is this race. And then this whole thing, it’s the race. It’s all the subject of refugees and what’s happening with refugees and where are they coming from. Biden as pledged, and you saw what happened the other day in France. Biden has pledged a 700% increase. This was done in the manifesto with Bernie Sanders. Crazy Bernie. He’s crazy. Is he crazy or what? But we love him because we got a big pile of his people last time with crooked Hillary. And they’re going to come again because we’re right on trade.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","30:50"
"Donald Trump","One thing Bernie Sanders understood, our country was being ripped off on trade by our allies and our foes, okay, by everybody. And he got it. He couldn’t do anything about it, but his people came over, large percentages of people. People find that hard to believe, but they understood trade. Biden has pledged a 700% increase. This is in conjunction with crazy Bernie and AOC plus three, who knows less about this stuff than any human being on earth. But she does have a good line of crap. A 700% increase in refugees from the most dangerous terror hotspots on the planet, including Syria, Somalia.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","31:28"
"Donald Trump","When I think of Somalia, I think of Omar, Omar, Ilhan, Ilhan Omar, who truly does not like our country. We are going to win Minnesota because of Omar, because of Omar. She likes telling us what we should do, how we should run our country. Isn’t that nice? Omar. No, we’re going to win. She hates our country and we’re going to win also because the national guard went in, should’ve been called a lot sooner. But the national guard went into Minneapolis and it was a beautiful sight. It took what? 22 minutes? It was over after a week and a half of destroying Minneapolis.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","32:12"
"Donald Trump","So I think between Ilhan Omar, Ilhan Omar and really what happened with respect. We stopped it. They should’ve called us a week and a half early. We’re going to win Minnesota first time since, think of that, first time, I don’t want to guarantee. I don’t want to guarantee anything. I’m a little bit superstitious, but I want to tell you, they like us. They like us in Minnesota and how the hell she gets elected I cannot understand it. His policies will turn Michigan into a refugee camp. It’s true. She goes, I know. You’re right about that. Who said that?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","32:58"
"Donald Trump","Right? She just said, I know. Everybody knows. He’s also vowed to terminate our national security travel bans. I got a travel ban. I said I want to ban. I took a lot of heat. You remember that right at the beginning. Because if it’s okay with you, I don’t want to have people that want to blow up our country. I don’t want to have people that want to kill our people. So we instituted a travel ban and it was rejected by the first court, rejected by the second court. Ultimately, it was approved by the US Supreme court. We have a travel ban.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","33:38"
"Donald Trump","And now if we have countries that want to do harm to us, if we have people that want to do harm, we say stay the hell out. It’s very easy. We got a travel ban. And we’re not going to open the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. We’re not doing it. I’ve ended the influx of refugees from terrorists regions, you know that, and I’m keeping the jihadists and the violent extremist the hell out of our country, if that’s okay. Now maybe you want them, I don’t know. Maybe you want them. Maybe Michigan, let’s take a vote. Would anybody like them to come to the wonderful state of Michigan?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","34:09"

"Donald Trump","Okay. I thought I knew you pretty well. No, it’s not easy doing this stuff, and it’s very unpopular. People go after you, but you have to do it. You have to do … Ultimately, I do what’s right, and people understand it. People understand it. Together, we will continue to protect American families, fight for American workers, support our police, defend our second amendment, which has been under siege. If I were not your president, you wouldn’t have a second amendment right now.

"Donald Trump","And by the way, do I look soaking wet? Because the media is going to get on me. They’re going to say, he looked like hell today. He didn’t look good. His hair was terrible. It was all horrible. He looked bad. He looked bad. He looked like he was sweating. Does he have a fever? No, it’s 32 degrees out here and it’s freezing and it’s raining, and I’m just trying to keep up with the tough people of Michigan. That’s all. See, I was going to ask you permission to put the hat on. No. Here, take it. That’s a good hat. It’ll be on eBay. It’ll be on eBay tonight. We will deliver record prosperity, epic job growth, and a safe vaccine that eradicates the virus and quickly ends the pandemic. And we’ve done things that nobody believed we could do. And the vaccines are coming right around the corner. And if I weren’t here, it would have taken two, three, four years before you had this stuff. It’s happening now, greatest companies in the world doing it. Normal life will fully resume, and that’s what we want. We want normal life, normal life. Take us back. Take us back seven months ago. We want normal life.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","35:40"

If we didn’t have the plague come in from China, it wasn’t even going to be like we had an election. The only bad part is I probably wouldn’t be standing out here in the freezing rain with you. I’d be home in the White House, doing whatever the hell I was doing. I wouldn’t be out here. And we’re going to do other great places after this. You know that, right? This is stop number one.

"Donald Trump","Because I’ll get off the plane, and they’ll say, he looks like hell. What happened to our president? Look at these people. What happened to our president? He looks terrible. This election is a choice between a Trump super recovery or a Biden depression. You’re going to have a depression, your 401(k)s down the tubes. Look how great our stock market, had a little blip yesterday because Nancy Pelosi will not approve stimulus. That’s all. But it’s a choice between a Trump boom or a Biden lockdown, but you’re already locked down.

Even a little nod, they say the president said, right? They asked me that question are crazy 60 Minutes. Wasn’t she rude? She just kept asking me questions. And then they interviewed sleepy Joe, and it was like, everybody just fell asleep. And they got great ratings. That’s unfortunate.

I said, just be fair. Just be fair. No, no. I mean tough questions. And I … This is the way it starts. With Biden, it’s hello, Mr. Vice President. How about did you see the reporters out? He was walking around with ice cream. What flavor is it? I don’t know. I don’t know. No, he knew. He said he had vanilla and I said, I don’t get … See those killers back there. I don’t get soft questions like that, but I was being interviewed by somebody.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","39:14"

"Donald Trump","But I was being interviewed by somebody. I had a group of terrible, terrible people. Sometimes I’ll do an interview just to see if it’s so bad, because I can do very good. I can answer the question. I take all the smiling, all the fun. I just boom, boom, boom. Nobody can do that. Boom, boom, gave him a perfect interview. And then I realized it’s hopeless with these people. And I looked at him, and we’re in the Oval Office. I say, “You know, you’re very unfair. You’re very dishonest. You’re corrupt people. But you know what? We’re in the Oval Office. I’m here, and you’re not.” I’m here, and you’re not. And I sent them on their way, and then I read the article the next day. It was terrible. It bore no relationship to what I told them, but these are minor details. It’s a shame. You know, if we had an honest media, this country would come together so fast. It’s true.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","40:03"
"Donald Trump","We have, not all of them, but they’re some of the most corrupt people on earth. They are. And you see it, you see it with the Biden corruption. They don’t even want it. They won’t cover it. They won’t talk about it, and that includes Big Tech, section 230. Section 230. Does anybody know about Section [230 00:01:18]? It’s a choice between our plan to kill the virus or Biden’s plan to kill the American dream. That’s what he wants to do. He wants to lock you all up. Let’s stay locked up. So I caught it, but I said, “Hey, I mean, I was given options. I could’ve stayed in the basement of the White House for a year and a half, but I’m your president. I can’t do that. I can’t do that. I can’t stay in the basement of the White House. I can’t stay in a beautiful bedroom upstairs for a year and a half. I’m your president.” And I’d go to meetings, and there’d be a lot of people at those meetings.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","40:58"
"Donald Trump","And they’d say, “This perhaps is dangerous. I don’t know, this perhaps…” And then one day, “Sir, our great White House physician, White House doctor, he’s here today.” Sean, where’s Sean? Is he around? He’s become more famous than I am, White House doctor. I saw so many doctors when I was in that bed. I said, “Doctor, I don’t feel good.” I had more great doctors, more talent than you’ve ever seen. They were lying around that. I told this story, they’re lying. 12, 12 doctors, Johns Hopkins, all of them. Walter Reed is so incredible. The medical military hospital, the doctors, they really are great, but there were a lot of them. I said, “I don’t feel great, Doc. I got to be honest with you. It’s been a long time, but I don’t feel great.” And they grabbed me, every one of them. They grabbed different parts of my body, and they all were specialists.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","41:53"
"Donald Trump","They were specialists. And the bottom line is I took something… Regeneron, which we’ll make it available to everybody that needs it, free. And Eli Lilly makes something very similar, and we have things that we didn’t even know about. Think about six months ago. And I don’t know if it was the strength of me. I’d like to give me full credit. I don’t want to give the drug… I was telling somebody the other day, “I don’t want to give the drug any credit.” I want to say, “Because I am a very young person that’s in perfect physical shape, I took that virus and I woke up the next morning and I felt like Superman.” It’s true.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","42:43"

We had no idea about much of this stuff. And you see mortality rate, you see where that is now. And people go in, you get better. They say you have immunity, that you can go in. I could jump… See this crowd right here? I could jump right in. I could give every woman and every man… I’d even kiss the men. I could give every woman and every man right here a kiss, and I wouldn’t catch it. I have immunity.

I said I had immunity. It was supposed to be for life. When it was me, they said it’s only good for four months. Okay. Anybody else, it’s for life. With Trump, they said it was four months. So they brought it down now, immunity, from life to four months. And you know now with them, you can’t watch anything else. You turn on… COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID. Well, we have a spike in cases. You ever notice, they don’t use the word death. They use the word cases, cases. Like, “Barron Trump is a case.” He has sniffles. He was sniffling. One Kleenex, that’s all he needed. One, and he was better. But he’s a case.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","44:06"
"Donald Trump","He’s a case, Barron Trump. Young people cases… And you know why we have so many cases? Because we test more, so we go around and they’re… By the way, we’re testing very young people, too. We’re testing people in school. We’re testing everybody. In many ways, I hate it. In many ways, I hate it. We test everybody, and because of that… Now, if I tested half… If I said, “We are going to cut our testing down in half,” they’d go crazy, because the cases would go down in approximately half. And then we’re going to cut it down in half once again. And there are other countries that don’t do testing, and they show very few cases. I mean, it’s a very simple thing, but overall it’s good to have the testing. We find out where it is, and there are a lot of things. But they use it to make us look bad, but here’s the story. It’s COVID, COVID, COVID. You can’t watch anything else. On November 4th, you won’t be hearing so much about it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","44:55"
"Donald Trump","November 4th. On November 4th, you’ll hear, “It’s getting better. It’s getting better.” You watch. No, no, they’re doing heavy COVID because they want to scare people, and people get it. I’ll tell you, they understand these people better than… You are smarter than most of the political people in this world. [inaudible 00:46:11] very smart. No, November 4th, you’ll see there’s a big difference. And I’ll tell you what. You know what else is going to happen on November 4th? Your governor, your governor at the urging of her husband who has abused our system very badly, the only man allowed in the state of Michigan, the only man allowed to go sailing is her husband. Now, your governor, I don’t think she likes me too much. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. I’m the one… It was our people that helped her out with her problem. I mean, we’ll have to see if it’s a problem. People are entitled to say, “Maybe it was a problem [inaudible 00:06:48].” It was our people, my people, our people, that helped her out, and then she blamed me for it. She blamed me, and it was our people that helped her. I don’t get it. How did you put her there? How did you put… How’s John James doing? Good? That’s good. Oh, he’s… I didn’t even know he was here. John. Wow, is that nice? Wow. I didn’t even know. See, I’m thinking about you and I don’t even know you’re here, John. I picked him out of a group of people they all had loaded up with money. John had money, he’s successful. Where he was really successful is in the military. He could pilot a helicopter better than anybody, I hear. And I said, “Who the hell is that guy?” It’s true. I saw John. I saw John. That’s in honor of John.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","45:49"
"Donald Trump","No, no, no. Here’s what happened, real quick. I saw John. I saw four people, a different position… He’s running for a different thing. He did great, by the way, but I saw four rich guys. And I saw John and I said, “Go back.” The world’s greatest invention. Not television, TiVo, because without TiVo, television is useless. So I say, “Who is that?” I don’t know, I think his name’s John James. I said, “Do me a favor. Go back.” Now, the other guys had a lot of money. They were spending a lot of money. I think four guys, four guys… I said, “That guy… I’m pretty good at this stuff. That guy can be a star.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","47:55"
"Donald Trump","I called him. I spoke to him. I endorsed him. The four rich guys will never talk to me again, but that’s okay. They were [gonezo 00:08:48]. That was the end of them. And he ran a phenomenal race. And now I’m hearing, John, that you’re actually leading. He’s running against the guy, Peters. Think of it. John James is running against a Senator, US Senator, that nobody has ever heard of before, even in Washington. Peters. I said, “Who the hell is Peters?” He’s a Senator from Michigan. Nobody’s ever heard of him. I’ll tell you what. If one thing comes out of this small group of thousands of people, vote for John James.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","48:38"
"Donald Trump","He’s a great guy, but I’m going to introduce him in a second. If Biden and the Democrat socialists are elected, they will dismantle your police departments, dissolve our borders, indoctrinate your children, and destroy the suburbs. You know, they were talking about suburban women don’t like Donald Trump. I said, “I think they do. I think they do.” I got rid of a regulation that will destroy the suburbs. I got rid of it. I said, “Ben Carson, let’s do it, Ben,” and we did it. Nobody else would do it. And if Biden ever got in, if he ever came in, it would come back and you could forget about the suburbs. And one thing I know about suburban women… Well, I was supposed to do badly with women the last time, remember? At the end, they called it that night. They said, “Donald Trump…” At the beginning, they said, “No, he won’t win because he doesn’t do well with women.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","49:25"
"Donald Trump","I said, “Really? Tell me about that.” And then… This guy goes, “only Rosie O’Donnell”. Who said that? You? What are you, a comedian or something? So they said, “Donald Trump, it will be a very short evening.” They were very happy about that, and then we started winning. We won Florida, we won Georgia. We won South Carolina and North Carolina. We ran all three. Then we won Michigan. We won Michigan. We won Wisconsin. You know, they were coming. We won Pennsylvania. Anyway, at the end of the evening, they were analyzing it. They said, “You know what? Donald Trump did great with women.” [inaudible 00:51:06]","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","50:19"
"Donald Trump","And that’s going to happen again, because women, suburban or otherwise, they want security. They want security. They want safety. They want law and order. They have to have law and order, and we’re going to do great. And I love women, and I can’t help it. They’re the greatest. I love them much more than the men, much more than the men. So I’m saving suburbia. I’m getting your kids back to school. Get your kids back to school. You know, we won that big Supreme Court case against your governor, so what the hell happened? Why isn’t it open? It’s still not open. You know, we sued. We won the case. What are they appealing? She’s appealing the case. Hey Governor, let your state open. Get your kids back to school, Governor. Not a good governor. And you know what else? I’m also getting your husbands… They want to get back to work. They want to get back to work. We’re getting your husbands back to work, and everybody wants it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","51:06"
"Donald Trump","And the cure can never be worse than the problem itself. And let me tell you, when she keeps everybody locked up like a prison, your drugs and alcohol and abuse and suicide, and so many things, so many bad things are happening. She’s got to get it back. And this goes for Pennsylvania. You have a Democrat. All Democrats… You have a Democrat governor. Goes for North Carolina. We’re doing great in both. We’re winning both of those states. You have a governor in each one, and you have a couple of others. Look at what’s going on in New York with Cuomo. It’s horrible. It’s like a ghost town, and the crime is way up. And California has to open up. California has to open up. I mean, what are you going to do? I see people today, store owners, they don’t know what to do. They’re going to be arrested if they open up their little small business. They can’t survive. It’s a horrible thing that’s going on. Get your states opened up. And this governor should get her state opened up.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","52:07"
"Donald Trump","The last administration nearly extinguished the US auto industry from the job… Killing it, almost. The job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership, and I ended it. I stopped it. To their horrendous Korea trade deal, that was a Hillary Clinton special. Remember, she said, “We will produce 250,000 jobs if we sign this deal,” and she was right for South Korea. They produced the… They got them. You didn’t get them. To the outrageous fuel economy standards where they’re making it impossible to build a car in this country. It’s outrageous. We sued California. We sued a lot of people, because we can build a better car, a safer car, a more important car for a lot less money. Think of that. Better, better looking, safer, little heavier, for a little bit more fuel, a little bit more. You’re talking about a glass, a little bit more fuel. And that will take 10 and 15 and 20-year old versions off, you know, the gas guzzlers, out of the…","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","53:06"
"Donald Trump","Overall, environmentally, it’ll be so good. And we’re suing California. Think of it, a better car, a safer car, and you’ll save $3,500 a car. And we actually have a lawsuit on this. We’re going to build better, cheaper, safer, and we actually have a lawsuit. I mean, it’s not even believable. Over a little glass of… Because the difference between an engine that works and doesn’t work is a half a glass of fuel, and we have plenty, as we’ve proven. We’re the number one in the world. We have plenty of gasoline. We have plenty of gasoline, and it would be great for your car business. And frankly, your car business, they ought to get in gear, because they’re so afraid of the environmentalists. You know, they’re so afraid. Oh, I don’t know. I mean, they’re willing to spend thousands more to build a car.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","54:09"
"Donald Trump","I say, fellas, are you sure? There are a couple of them that are very smart that like what I say. I’ll tell you who the smart ones are some day. I reversed each and every one of those Obama-Biden disasters, and now Biden wants to reinstate all of them. Everything that we’ve knocked out in terms of regulations that would take 20 years to build a highway, we have it down to 2 years. To get the approvals would take 20 years, even longer. We have it down to 2. I want to get it down to 1, and it may get rejected for environmental or safety reasons. I want to get it down to 1. But you have to see what we’ve done is a miracle, and that’s one of the reasons it’s been so successful. I also ended the NAFTA nightmare and replaced it with the brand new USMCA. And the USMCA is expected to create tens of thousands of auto jobs that include powerful productions to keep your auto lines going. Wait till you see what happens. It’s just kicking in right now, and one of the biggest beneficiaries will be a state named Michigan.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","54:59"
"Donald Trump","And when General Motors went bankrupt, Biden and Obama threw the workers of the Delphi corporation to the wolves. Anybody from Delphi here? Because somebody, if you’re here, you got to like Trump, because we’re working on getting their pensions taken care of, because they were taken advantage of. You know about that. I signed an order to restore the pensions and healthcare benefits promise to workers in Wisconsin, Ohio, and Michigan. So they were treated very badly, and so were you. I will never let anyone rip off our great American worker. I will not do it. Joe Biden’s made a corrupt bargain exchange for his party’s nomination. He has handed control of his party over to the rage-filled socialists, Marxists, and left-wing extremists. If Biden wins, the flag-burning radicals on the streets will be running your government, like in Portland. The anarchists, the Antifa. Hey, Antifa…","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","56:04"
"Donald Trump","You ever notice, they never want to go after Antifa? Nobody wants to take on it. They all want to go after anybody, but they don’t want… And I keep saying, “Well, how are we doing with Antifa, the anarchists?” This Election Day, you must stop the anti-American radicals by delivering Joe Biden and the far left a thundering defeat. We have to make this… You have to get out there on Monday, Tuesday, Sunday, I don’t care, today. You have to get out there and vote. Most of you are going to vote because you believe in voting, like I do. I just left. I just voted two days ago. I voted. I went to a booth, and they actually asked me, “Sir, may I please have your identification?” But no, they’re right in doing it. I gave her a passport. “Sir, do you have additional identification?” [inaudible 00:57:53] Come on, what are you doing? You’re going to embarrass me here. This is crazy. No, she was great.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","57:05"
"Donald Trump","I mean, I’ll tell you what. There’s no cheating with that. You go to a place, they want identification, they want this. You fill out your form, they walk you over to a machine, you put it in. I mean, these ballots, it’s turning out to be exactly what I said. You see what’s going on. Who’s sending them? Where are they going? Who’s sending them back? Who’s signing them? Now they want to have unverified signature. One of the governors wants to have no signature at all, just send it back. What a horrible thing, especially since I see so… You know, I watched it so closely this time when I voted. It was so professional. You go in, and most of these people, the Red Wave, generally speaking, you go… If not Tuesday, Monday, whatever, how many people are going to vote? How many people?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-lansing-michigan-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Lansing, Michigan October 27","57:58"

They want to go to a polling booth. You’re like that. Everybody, look. This is the most important election in the history of our country, or I wouldn’t be standing here like this. Everybody, you got to go out and vote. You got to go out and vote. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician. You’ve seen that. He wants to send your jobs to China while his family rakes in millions of dollars from the Chinese Communist Party and other places. If Biden wins, China wins. And by the way, China will own the United States. You saw that clip up there. They will own it. China’s wonderful. There has never been anyone or anything or any country that has ripped us off like China. We will win, you will win, Michigan will win, and America will win.

They’re incredible. I’ll tell you what, they have been with me right from the beginning, right fellas? They like you, they like you. Michigan House Speaker, Lee Chatfield. Lee. Young guy, Lee. A young guy. RNC Chairwoman, who by the way, ran my Michigan campaign four years ago, Ronna McDaniel. She ran it so good that when we won, I said, “I have the person, the head of the Republican Party,” I said, “I want to get somebody.” I said, “You know what I’ll do? Get me the woman that won Michigan. What the hell is her name?” Her name’s Ronna. Good. She would call me, I’d come. I’d make a speech, I’d leave.

I said, “Look, I’ll do it one more time. That’s it.” I came back. She said, “That’s it, sir. Don’t worry about it.” I left. Two days later, I get a one more phone call. “Sir, one more visit.” And we did. Do you know, Michigan was the last stop that I made. I made it in Grand Rapids, Michigan. It was one o’clock in the morning. Crooked Hillary had come in with Barack Hussein Obama. And they came in together with Bill Clinton actually and all of them. And it was unscheduled. Meaning they found out they had a problem, right? It was unscheduled. They got here at seven o’clock. They had 500 people. I got here at one o’clock in the morning.

And the next US Senator, from the great state of Michigan, the legendary John Jay. I’ll tell you, he’s working so hard. Just keep working, John, keep working. We built the greatest economy in history, and now we are doing it again. We increased middle-class family income over $6,000 more than five times, again, think of this five times again, in all eight years under the last administration. African American unemployment, Hispanic American unemployment, and Asian American unemployment all reached their lowest levels, ever recorded.

For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars and defending foreign borders. But now we are finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in United States history. That’s what we’ve done. It’s an amazing thing what we’ve done. My opponent’s insane immigration plan would completely eliminate US borders. They don’t want to have borders. Without a border, you don’t have a country. By implementing a nationwide catch and release. You catch a criminal, murderer, rapist and you release them into our country.

My administration is finding the illegal immigrant and the criminals gang members, the MS-13 killers, and we are either putting them in jail or sending them back home. And their home has to take them. They didn’t used to take them. We invested $2.5 trillion into the US military. Much of it’s spent in Michigan and we have the finest, greatest equipment anywhere in the world. We are the envy of the world. Russia, China, there’s no country. We are the envy of the world.

And the first call I get, if we win, we got to win, first call I get will be from Iran. They’re going to want to make a deal so badly, because their economy is in tatters. I recognize the true capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. And instead of never-ending wars, we are forging peace in the middle East.

Standing up for the great people of Iowa. “Sir, sir, it’s Michigan.” There’s no recovery from that, right? When you do that, you just walk off the stage, right? I always say the great Winston Churchill, he was a great orator, even if Winston Churchill did it, he would just walk off the stage. But he didn’t do that. But sleepy Joe does it a lot.
