"Mike Pence","Well, hello Minnesota. It is great to be back in the North Star State. Thank you for that warm welcome. But I’m here for one reason, and one reason only, that Minnesota and America need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. Like all of you, I’m here because I stand with President Donald Trump. When this president stands up for American workers, from the cities to the Iron Range, I stand with President Donald Trump. When this president stands up for faith, and freedom, and the American flag, I stand with President Donald Trump. And when this president stands up to the radical Democrats in Congress trying to overturn the will of the American people with endless investigations and partisan politics, we stand with President Donald Trump.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","00:17"
"Mike Pence","You know what began four years ago has grown into a movement, a movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life. All of you believe we could be strong again. You believe we could be prosperous again. America said yes to president Donald Trump in 2016, and Minnesota, I know you’re going to say yes to four more years of president Donald Trump in 2020.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","02:04"
"Mike Pence","When you think of the last three years, there’s only one way you can describe it. It’s been three years of action. It’s been three years of results. It’s been three years of promises made and promises kept. But we’re just getting started, Minnesota. I mean, think about it, this president promised to rebuild our military, and President Trump has signed the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","02:43"
"Mike Pence","He promised to stand with our veterans and give our veterans access to the real-time world-class healthcare that you earned, we reformed the VA, and Veterans Choice is now available for every veteran. And this president promised to secure our border, we made historic investments in border security. Apprehensions on our Southern border are already down by 60%. And we’ve already started to build that wall on the Southern border of the United States. We’re doing it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","03:29"

"Mike Pence","And President Trump promised to appoint principled conservatives to our federal courts at every level. And at last count, he’s appointed 180 men and women who will uphold the God-given liberties in our Constitution, like the freedom of religion and the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. And this president promised, he promised to stand with the men and women of law enforcement at every level. And we’ve done just that. As the Cops for Trump know, Trump’s for cops.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","04:28"
"Mike Pence","And finally, President Trump promised to revive the American economy, he cut taxes across the board, we rolled back red tape at a record level, unleashed American energy, and Minnesota’s economy is booming. It’s true. Since Election Day 2016, 6.4 million new jobs have been created by businesses, large and small. Unemployment’s at a 50-year low, and there’s more Americans working today than ever before in the history of this country.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","05:17"
"Mike Pence","On one promise after another, President Donald Trump delivered. And thanks to the president’s leadership and our strong conservative allies in Congress, like Congressman Tom Emmer, Congressman Jim Hagedorn, Congressman Pete Stauber, we’ve made America great again. It’s true. But to keep America great, we need you to decide right here and right now that Minnesota is going to vote for four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","06:07"

"Mike Pence","The choice in this election couldn’t be clearer, and the stakes couldn’t be higher. Today we have a president who loves this country, who stands by our military, our law enforcement, our workers, and our freedoms. He never quits. He never backs down. He believes in you, and he fights for you every single day.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","07:46"
"Mike Pence","And that’s more can you can say for those do-nothing Democrats in Washington DC. I mean, the truth is the Democratic Party has been taken over by radical leftists who want higher taxes, open borders, late-term abortion, and socialist policies that would crush our economy. And worst of all, today’s Democrats have spent the last three years trying to overturn the will of the American people in the last election. And they’re back at it again. But despite three years of non-stop resistance and investigations and obstruction by the Democrats and the media, I’m here to tell you President Donald Trump has never stopped fighting to keep the promises that he made to the people of Minnesota, and he never will.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","08:06"
"Mike Pence","But now, Minnesota, it’s our turn to fight for him. I mean, it’s on. And we got work to do. And it’s going to take all of us to do it. So we need you to bring your enthusiasm, be ready to volunteer your time, voice your support, and get ready to get out the vote for four more years of President Donald Trump in November of 2020.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","09:15"
"Mike Pence","And while you’re bringing all that energy and enthusiasm, bring your faith too. Bring faith in this president, whose drive and vision has made America great again. Have faith in our fellow Americans, that every time they’re given a choice between more freedom and more government, the American people choose freedom every single time. And finally, finally, have that faith that he who blessed this one nation under God will still bless America beyond anything that we can ask and imagine.

"Mike Pence","Ladies and gentlemen, I can tell you firsthand, President Donald Trump is the real deal. He’s a man who says what he means, and means what he says. And I see every day, he gets up and fights to keep the promises that he made to the people of Minnesota and the people of all this country. He’s made America great again. And with your support and your prayers, I know he will keep America great.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","10:42"

This feels like the day before the election. So we have 20,000-plus people inside. We just set a new record. And we have 25,000 people that we still love, outside.

It is great to be back in the Twin Cities with the freedom-loving American patriots who make our country run. You know that. You know it.

"Donald Trump","America now has the number one economy anywhere in the world, and it’s not even close. You know I’m dealing with China right now. They’re in Washington. We’re going to see if we make a deal. But they want to make it. We’re going to determine whether or not we want to make it. But they’ve been very nice. And today I got a call from one of the top representatives, he said, “Congratulations, Mr. President, on having a truly great, great economy.” That’s pretty nice.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","16:17"

"Donald Trump","And I have to say, there are a lot of very beautiful red T-shirts in the audience. That was a record sale. They did very well. And I’ll tell you what: cops love Trump, Trump loves cops. Our bold pursuit of this pro-American agenda has enraged, and you know what’s happened, it’s enraged the failed ruling class in Washington. Not easy to get them out, but we’re doing it slowly, but surely. These corrupt politicians and the radical leftists got rich bleeding America dry. And they knew that my election would finally end their pillaging and looting of our country. And that’s what they were doing. And that’s what they continue to try and do. That is why, from day one, the wretched Washington swamp has been trying to nullify the results of a truly great and democratic election, the election of 2016. They’re trying. They’re not getting very far. They want to erase your vote like it never existed. They want to erase your voice. And they want to erase your future. But they will fail, because in America, the people rule again.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","18:18"
"Donald Trump","Do you remember that, just 19 minutes after I raised my hand and took the oath of office, The Washington Post, a terrible newspaper that doesn’t know how to write the truth, published a story, and in this case, they might’ve gotten it pretty correct, they said, “The Campaign To Impeach President Trump Has Begun.” That was the headline.

The phony Russia hoax. ” Lisa, I love you.” Now the do-nothing Democrat con artists and scammers are getting desperate. 13 months, they got to move fast, because they’re not beating us at the polls and they know it, despite the phony polls that you see all the time, their phony polls. You know, polls are no different. Remember I always used to talk about polls, I know polls very well. Polls are no different than crooked writers. They’re crooked polls. They’re crooked polls.

And they could be so good for our country. They could be so good. And maybe they’ll change, and maybe they won’t. I’ve been waiting for a long time. After I won the last election, I said, “Finally it’s okay. Finally I’ll get some great press.” They got worse. They got worse. I said, “Finally, we’re going to get …” I said to the first lady, “Darling, we’re going to finally get respect. We’re going to finally get media and press coverage. It’s going to be great.

If you believe them, there’s no way anybody could … Because it’s like 94% … I can do the greatest things in history, and they’ll make them bad to very bad.

How about on the newscast, like the word “manufactured,” it’s manu… And every newscast, “Tonight, in a manufactured deal along the border …” The word’s never been used … All of a sudden every newscast is using it.

"Donald Trump","So they know they can’t win the 2020 election, so they’re pursuing the insane impeachment witch hunt. I’ve been going through it now for more time than I’ve been in office. Because, like Strzok with his insurance deal, this was before, remember this, this was before, that statement was made months before I took office. That statement was made months before the election took place. They said, “Just in case, we’re going to have an insurance policy.” That only means one thing, “We’re going to get him out.” So they’re telling us. We can’t let that ever happen again to another president.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","24:52"
"Donald Trump","And Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, a lot of people, the great Mark Levin. We have a lot of great people. Lou Dobbs, great people. You know what they said? Every one of them, plus many others, “There’s no other man that we’ve ever met that could have taken it.” It’s true. Maybe I’m a little different up here. I don’t know. But I enjoy it. To me, I’m energized because we’re draining the swamp. The Democrats’ brazen attempt to overthrow our government will produce a backlash at the ballot box the likes of which they have never ever seen before in the history of this country. These are bad people. My phone call, as an example, with the president of Ukraine, was perfect. Everybody that looked at it. And the only reason I released it was that the Democrats put out a phony narrative. So I had no choice. And I don’t want to do that as president, every time a president from a country calls me, or I call them, we have to release the text. How can you do business that way? Who’s going to want to speak to your president? So the president of Ukraine reiterated today at a major news conference, on other subjects, that he was under absolutely no pressure. He doesn’t even know what they’re talking about. And he used the word, there was no “blackmail” during this call. He used that term. So in theory, that should be the end of it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","25:51"
"Donald Trump","Think of it, a president of the United States who’s made our economy, with a lot of help from all of you, frankly, but from Mike and from some of our great senators and some of our great people that we have with us, we made this the strongest economy in our history. We’ve rebuilt our military. We’re taking care of healthcare like nobody’s been able to do. What we’ve done is incredible. And by the way, we’re protecting your Second Amendment.

"Donald Trump","So we were really forced, just to put it away, we were forced. I said, “Just do it.” Got the approval from Ukraine. I have to ask. I said, “Hey, do you guys mind?” They said, “That’s a strange request.” I said, “Don’t worry about it. Do you mind?” And they said, “Please, go ahead.

Had they waited one day longer, they would have had the transcript of the actual call, word for word. It would’ve been perfect. Instead, they released it, they went early, they said all these horrible things. You know why?

"Donald Trump","So Nancy Pelosi, upon hearing a false story from a whistleblower that had no clue what was going on in that call, or somebody gave her very bad advice, but also hearing it from shifty shift Nancy Pelosi said, a day before seeing the transcript of the call with the Ukrainian president, “We’ve got to impeach him. We’ve got to impeach him.” Right? And then she saw the call and she said to her people, “What the hell?

I don’t think so. As our brilliant White House counsel wrote to the Democrats yesterday, he said, “Their highly partisan and unconstitutional effort threatens grave and lasting damage to our democratic institutions, to our system of free elections, and to the American people.” That’s what it is. To the American people. It’s so terrible. Democrats are on a crusade to destroy our democracy. That’s what’s happening. We will never let it happen. We will defeat them. I mean, look at their debates. These people are crazy. They want to spend $99 trillion to redo buildings all over the United States. I said, “What about China? What about Russia? What about India? What about all these other countries where that stuff is just flowing out?” It’s all right. Let him give you the answer. Man, did the cops act fast. He’s already gone. That’s unbelievable.

And we’ve set every record at every place, virtually, that we’ve gone. And one of the big musicians said, “And Trump does it without a guitar.” Can you believe it? Without a guitar.

But it’s like the way they change those tires, takes four seconds to change the whole damn thing. I say, “How the hell do they do it?” That’s the way these cops just reacted. That was a record. I think it was a … I’ve had good service, but I’ve never had anything like that. I look up, the guy is already gone. Ah, we love you with the red shirts. So now the Democrats are making a pathetic bid to save sleepy Joe, sleepy Joe Biden. And you know what? I’d love to run against him, to be honest. Anybody like that. If you can’t beat him in a debate, you’ve got a big problem folks. You can’t beat him in a debate, you can’t be president. Because what are you going to do against President Xi and Kim Jong Un. You can’t beat sleepy Joe, but now we’re going to meet with Kim Jong Un? I don’t think so. But he’s totally owned and totally controlled by the Washington swamp for many years.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","34:49"
"Donald Trump","Two months after president Obama put Joe in charge of Ukraine policy, they put Joe Biden in charge of Ukraine policy. Listen to this. And the press will not write it. They say, “In totally unsubstantiated charges …” every time they talk about him. President Trump has said that his son walked away with a fortune. Now you know that’s a totally unsubstantiated charge. Really? It’s not an unsubstantiated, it’s fact. Joe’s son Hunter got thrown out of the Navy and then he became a genius on Wall Street in about two days.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","36:13"
"Donald Trump","By the way, whatever happened to Hunter. Where the hell is he? Where’s Hunter? Hey fellows, I have an idea for a new t-shirt. I love the cops, but let’s do another t-shirt. Where’s Hunter? Where is he? Here’s Hunter, being examined by sleepy eyes Chuck Todd or some of these people. Hunter, it’s so great that you’re here, sir. Hunter, I know they’re giving you approximately $168,000 a month. I hear they paid you a big check of $3 million. I just want to speak on behalf of NBC who’s absolutely one of the worst. I just want to tell you … Hunter, Hunter I just want to tell you I couldn’t be happier for you and your family and I know you don’t know anything about energy and I know it’s an energy company, but I think they made a great deal, Hunter. And then they fly to China, and I’m dealing with people right now. They’re tough as hell, those Chinese negotiators, and Hunter, who’s not too smart, Hunter. He goes in, he has a meeting, he walks out in his fund with 1.5 billion, with a B, one point five billion dollars. These aren’t the same Chinese negotiators that I’m dealing with, I can tell you. These are not the same ones, but we are doing very well in that negotiation. Now, think of it, where’s Hunter? Where is Hunter? I want to see Hunter? Hunter, you know nothing about energy, you know nothing about China, you know nothing about anything, frankly. Hunter, you’re a loser. Why did you get one point five billion dollars, Hunter. And your father was never considered smart. He was never considered a good Senator. He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama’s ass. True. Thank you. Thank you. It’s true. It’s true. And they’re always saying the same thing. Yeah, he got a billion five, we admit it, they admit it, it’s nothing, but oh, it’s not that same thing, president Trump made a totally unsubstantiated claim about Hunter Biden and his father. It’s not unsubstantiated, you crooked son of a guns, it’s 100% true. 100%. Even the smart guys on Wall Street, and I know all of them, they are smart. They’ve never seen anything like that one before. I’ve called them. Does that ever happen? Never happens. Guy walks in, no experience, no nothing. Walks out with a billion five. Gee. Flies in on Air Force Two with his father, the vice president. Don’t forget, that’s when he was vice president. So China gives his son 1.5 billion. How would you like to have Joe Biden take over negotiations right now with China? I don’t think so.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","36:49"
"Donald Trump","I don’t think so. Meanwhile, Biden allowed China to rip off America for eight years as vice president, and Barack Obama let him just rob us blind, and we’re not doing that anymore. Those days are over. The Bidens got rich and that is substantiated. While America got robbed, that’s what happened. Sleepy Joe and his friends out America, they didn’t have tough negotiations. I look at these trade deals and I say, “Who the hell could have done this?” If you didn’t … If you had no business instinct, no business ability, if you had nothing, if you’re dumb as hell, you wouldn’t make these deals, they’re so bad. I say, “Who made these deals? Who made these deals?” But we’re ripping them all up and redoing them and they’re going to be very good. Wait until you see what happens. Now that I’m your president, you see it.

That’s very nice. That’s really good. That’s the way you should do it. Good. Good. Good. In the twisted worldview of Democrats and the media, it’s okay for politicians to ship our jobs to foreign countries, flood our communities with drugs and crime, and enrich themselves at America’s expense. Their treachery is allowed because they go along with the rigged Washington game, and it is far more rigged. When I ran, I thought it was rigged, but this is crazy what’s happening.

I think he’s the greatest ad negotiator in history, and I told them, I said, “Would you do me a favor? All the money we spend on these political campaigns, if I gave some of that money to Mike, I think it would have ads every single minute of every single show.” I never saw so many. Anyway. But the lawless political establishment will try to frame you. They’ll persecute you. They’ll swear and just swear up and down that they’re telling the truth. When Nancy Pelosi was on television the other day … I have to say, I have to say I was very proud of George Stephanopoulos. I was very proud. It’s not often. She said, “No, no shifty shift told the truth when he said that.” Stephanopoulos said, “No way. No, no. It wasn’t the truth. It was a false statement.” No, no. It was the truth. He said, “No.” And she really believes it. So she’s either got one of two problems. She’s either really stupid, okay? Or she’s really lost it.

They wanted to turn the country around. They wanted to do great things. All of a sudden they get summoned and they get subpoenaed by Robert Mueller. How good was he as a witness? Not too good and by people that were, I call them the 13 angry Democrats, that turned into 18 angry Democrats. It was disgraceful. So people that were going down, “Sir, what is this?” I look, “Oh wow, that’s a subpoena.” What the hell is this? They took people … I really mean this. They took people that were full of life and energy and vigor. We had just won the greatest campaign in the history of American politics, it’s true. It’s true. And they destroyed their lives.

It’s so beautiful.” And he said, “President.” I said, “Call me Donald. You’ve called me Donald for 35 years.” “I will. Thank you Donald.” I’ve lost all my friends because they’re all scared to talk.

Congresswoman Omar is an America hating socialist. She minimized the September 11th attack on our homeland. Where far more than 3,000 people died, saying, “Some people did something big deal. Some people did something.” She pleaded for compassion for ISIS recruits right here in Minnesota. Omar laughed that Americans speak of Al-Qaeda. You remember that tape? Speak of Al-Qaeda. But when we say something about the United States, you just don’t say America with any intensity. Remember that? Representative Omar has a history of launching virulent anti-semitic screeds, whether you like it or not. She’s said the US support for Israel is all about the Benjamins. She said that pro-Israel lawmakers have an allegiance to a foreign country.

"Donald Trump","It’s true. But I kept going. They say, “Why?” I said, “Well, first of all, it is really a beautiful place,” but we won the point. But they said, “He can not get to 270,” and I heard this for months and months. I had such a headache, almost as bad as listening to Mike’s damn commercials about those pillows. Maybe I need one of those pillows to cure my headache. Does it cure headaches?

There’s no way of doing it, and they were right. I got to 306. They were right. But I didn’t get to 306. You got to 306. We won incredible states. We won incredible states.

"Donald Trump","What a run. Do you remember the evening that we won? I think… Look, forgetting me, I think it was won of all of us together because we all worked hard. I was the messenger, but we all worked hard. That was our victory, not my victory. But that was one of the greatest nights in the history of television, one of the greatest nights, and hopefully it’ll go down when we’re allowed to get all of this stuff seeded… You know, it’s like a tree.

But I think it’ll go down, and I hope it’s going to go down as one of the greatest evenings in the history of this country, because it’s never happened, anything like that before. And these guys don’t even question it. They just sit back and say, “I guess he’s right about that.” I’ll never forget the night before, I was at a tremendous arena. The place was going crazy. It was like this, going crazy, and two reporters that hate my guts, they looked at themselves, they looked at each other.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","01:09:32"

And I didn’t need Beyonce and Jay Z, and I didn’t need little Bruce Springsteen and all of these people. They’d get all these people. They’d come in because she couldn’t get a crowd. They’d come in, they’d sing. They got Bruce Springsteen. Okay? He’d do about two songs and leave. What happens is, they leave, and then everyone leaves with them, and she’s still speaking in front of the same lousy crowd.

They’re going to say things that’s going to want to make your wife say, “Why did I marry this guy?” Just say, “Don’t worry about it.

And I don’t know why, but with all of the great people I just introduced, for tonight, maybe this is the most important person, because I turned on a very good show in the morning. Fox and friends.

And sometimes, Pete Hegseth gets on there for the [inaudible 01:15:02] And how good does Jessie Waters do? How good? Right? Just some really great people. And again, Tucker’s been very good I have to say. He’s been good. Smart. He’s been great. Tucker, and the legendary Sean Hannity. Great. Number one. Number one show. Sean’s got the number one show.

And he’s talking about this lousy mayor they’ve got. Now, he didn’t quite say that, but I say it. He’s talking about this lousy mayor that won’t let the cops, the police, the law enforcement… My father always used to say, “Son…” And he meant it to. “Never say cops. It’s disrespectful. Say police officer.” I said, “Okay Pop.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","01:16:31"

You are so great, so respected. You don’t even know how much our public loves you. You don’t know it. You don’t know it. You don’t know it. But I see this guy, and I don’t know if he’s done a lot of television before, but he was very effective and very good. And he was saying how the police aren’t being allowed to take care of this rally, and yet with President Obama and Bush and all these people, they were fine, fine.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","01:17:09"

Yes Mom.” But the job he did before the election, I came right here to Minnesota, and I pledged to address this really important issue, and it’s the issue of law enforcement.

"Donald Trump","Thank you very much. Thank you. Great people. Thank you. What a group. I think your very weak mayor made a mistake when he took them on. As you know, for many years, leaders in Washington brought large numbers of refugees to your state from Somalia without considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers. I promised you that as president, I would give local communities a greater say in refugee policy, and put in place enhanced vetting and responsible immigration controls.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","01:21:05"
"Donald Trump","And I’ve done that. Since coming into office, I have reduced refugee resettlement by 85%, and as you know, maybe especially in Minnesota, I kept another promise. I issued an executive action, making clear that no refugees will be resettled in any city or any state without the express written consent of that city or that state. So speak to your mayor. You should be able to decide what is best for your own cities and for your own neighborhoods, and that’s what you have the right to do right now. And believe me, no other president would be doing that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","01:22:13"
"Donald Trump","If Democrats were ever to seize power, they would open the floodgates to unvetted, uncontrolled migration at levels you have never seen before. Do you think you have it bad now? You would never have seen anything like what they want to do. But in the Trump administration, we will always protect American families first, and that has not been done in Minnesota. We’ve also implemented the strongest screening and vetting mechanisms ever put into place. We are keeping terrorists, criminals and extremists the hell out of our country. And I want to thank the country of Mexico. The president of Mexico has been incredible. We have now, 27,000 Mexican soldiers. They’re great, and they’re tough, and they are now protecting our border, and those numbers have gone down like this. Thank you Mr. President. We will not make the mistakes made in European countries, that allow a violent ideology to take root in our country, on our shores. We’re not going to allow it to happen. And as you all know, to protect our citizens from those who would do harm to us, I instituted a very controversial, very hard to get, travel ban on some of the world’s most dangerous countries.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","01:23:12"

I lost, and then I lost at the appellate division, and then I won at the United States Supreme Court. Right? And he knew that, but he said I lost on the… And he was right. I lost, and then I lost again, but then I won, and we have the travel ban. But instead of saying, “He lost, and then he lost at the appellate, and then he won at the United States Supreme Court,” he said, “He lost on the travel ban.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","01:25:14"

In the Republican party, we believe that those who seek to join our society must embrace our values, honor our history, and love our people. Democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities, which release dangerous criminal aliens into the heart of your communities, and we’re not letting it happen anymore. Republicans believe American cities should be sanctuaries for Americans, not for criminal aliens. My administration is taking historic action to secure the border. We have reduced illegal border crossings by over 60% since May, and we are building the wall faster than anyone ever anticipated it could be built. And this is a serious wall. You’ve all seen it. It’s going up rapidly, and you think that was easy? I had every Democrat in Congress fighting me, fighting me, fighting me. I had a lot of the rhinos fighting me. They say, “See, he’s not getting it built. He’s not getting…” Let me tell you.

That’s the biggest patchwork of financing you’ve ever seen, and that sucker is going up, and it is the finest, it is the strongest, it’s largely 30 feet tall, which is the maximum height that they wanted. I went to the Border Patrol, and I sat down with 15 representatives of the Border Patrol, and I said, “What do you want? What’s your ideal?” I actually said, “I want to give you the Rolls Royce,” and they killed me for that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","01:27:47"

But I said, “I want to give you the Rolls Royce of walls. Tell me.” And they told me everything, and then we built some alternative walls. We built all different types. We built about seven of them, and then we had climbers come in. The one that worked the best was the one we’re building. It also, unfortunately… The bad news, it’s also the most expensive.

And the Democrats knew this. Most of the Democrats four years ago, they wanted a wall. Now all of a sudden, they don’t want a wall. You know why they don’t want a wall? Because I want it. That’s the only reason. And I just thought of it a year ago. I said, “Man, this could’ve been so much easier.” All I had to do is say, “We don’t want a wall,” and they would’ve given me all the financing I wanted for the wall. What was I thinking?

I’m so sorry.” And every letter is individually done because sometimes the parents, they’re grieving, and they get together with other parents, and I don’t want to see that it’s like the same letter.

And sometimes I send letters out, it’s called blue on green, where we’re teaching people how to fight and then they turn the gun on our soldiers and shoot them in the back. And that’s the hardest thing for a parent. I have all of them. I know everyone. That’s the hardest thing for a parent when they get notification, because they learn how their child has died. When the so-called people that were teaching how to fight turn the gun on them, and shoot. We’ve had a lot of that, a lot of it in Afghanistan, more than we’ve ever had proportionately before.

We meet them, and we talked to them, and their son or daughter is being flown in from some far away place in a coffin, and these things are just impossible. I don’t know how parents can do it, even.

You’ll see.” And I didn’t know what he was talking about, this is the first time.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","01:35:18"
"Donald Trump","Then we went outside to the runway, and this incredible machine is flying in, and it lands, and it comes over, and it pulls up, and we have military guards, we have incredible talented musicians that do this. That’s what they do. What happens is that door opens up, and the Colonel told me, he said, “Sir, when that door opens up, those same people that you think are okay, do things that you’ll never see. You will hear sounds like you’ve never heard.” That’s what he does.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","01:35:51"
"Donald Trump","I saw that door open up with a coffin with a flag over it. The door was opened, and these beautiful soldiers, five or six on each side, lifting the coffin and walking down the runway, the plank, they call it, off this cargo plane. And I see parents make sounds, that were just 20 minutes ago absolutely fine, make sounds, scream and cry like you’ve never seen before. The Colonel was telling me that, “Sir, you’ll see things that you’ve never seen before. A mother who was fine 20 minutes ago, you think, breaking the military line and jumping off, and then jumping onto a coffin of her son or her daughter, jumping on, on top of the flowers, on top of the American flag.” I’ve seen this.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","01:36:25"
"Donald Trump","Then I have all these people that want to stay. They want to stay. And I don’t want to stay. We were supposed to be in Syria for 30 days. We’ve now been there for 10 years. We were supposed to be in Afghanistan for a short period of time. We’re now going to be there for close to 19 years. It’s time to bring them home. It’s time to bring them home. It’s true. Time to bring them home. We’ve done our job, we’ve defeated everyone that we’re supposed to defeat. And now we are, we are policing, we are now policing. That’s what we’re doing. We’re policing. And that, as I said, no more respect for the police, but these are military people, and those are police, but we are now policing. We’re not fighting, we’re policing. And you know what? After all of these years … One other story, and I have to tell you. I go to Walter Reed on Friday, and I do it quite often. I gave out five Purple Hearts. And I meet people that are so beautiful, so amazing. I met five warriors, and one was so badly hurt, with the loss of arms and a leg, another one … they’re just very, very devastated. But these are great, great people. And I gave out the Purple Heart. And I see the parents, and I have to say, Walter Reed, I want to just say, the doctors there, the job they do, you know, you hear so many complaints about doctors and about the vets, and the vets’ care, and nobody’s done better. We got choice for the vets. We did things for the vets that nobody thought would be possible.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","01:37:21"
"Donald Trump","But I saw these young men, and I gave them their Purple Hearts. And their parents were there crying. And one of them was so amazing. I said, “What’s your problem?” “Sir, my face was blown apart. My nose was absolutely just blown apart.” He said, “Sir, it’s incredible.” And I looked at him, I said, “That’s the most beautiful nose I’ve ever seen. What do you mean?” He said, “A doctor worked on my face for 10 hours in the field. He said there were a thousand fragments.” Now I don’t know if that’s right, but well, a lot. He meant a lot. “He said there were a thousand fragments. He rebuilt my nose with glue. He glued the bones together. He rebuilt my nose.” I say, “You have the most beautiful nose I’ve ever seen,” and it’s true. And his father came over to me, he said, “Sir,” father was crying, he said, “Sir, honestly, my son looks better now.” He said, “My son did not have a good look. He knows. Now look at it, it’s beautiful, it’s beautiful.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","01:39:26"
"Donald Trump","But these doctors at Walter Reed, and these Army, and Marine, and the medical doctors, they are unbelievably great people. And they see sights that you and I hopefully will never see. They see things that nobody will ever see, and there’s nobody like them. And I have to give a shout out to those people, there’s nobody like them. So in the case of Turkey, and Syria, and the Kurds, we could send in a thousand troops for a military conflict with Turkey. No, you don’t want to do that. We could hit Turkey very hard financially. Or we could mediate a deal between Turkey and the Kurds. I like that. You know? Let’s mediate a deal. But remember they’ve been fighting each other for hundreds of years, and we were artificially put there, in this case by President Obama. So we did our job. We knocked out.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","01:40:34"
"Donald Trump","And I’ll tell you another thing, we have to be treated fairly. We have to be treated fairly. We’re not treated fairly by other nations. We captured many, many ISIS fighters. Most of them came from Europe. They came from Germany. They came from France. They came from all of these countries. And we called them, I called them myself in many cases, I said, “Take your fighters.” They said, “We don’t want them. You take them.” I said, “No, no, no, we did you a big favor. They’re citizens of Germany. They’re citizens of France. They’re citizens of these various countries in Europe. Take your fighters.” “We don’t want them, sir. We don’t want them.’ And I said, “How unfair are we treated? We do them a great favor, and they won’t take the fighters.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","01:41:39"
"Donald Trump","So we’re doing some things that are pretty amazing. Every once in a while you have to change course, and do what you have to do. The United States has spent $8 trillion in the Middle East. We’ve lost thousands of brave soldiers, and tens of thousands of terribly wounded people, great people, their lives will never be the same. These wars produced only chaos and bloodshed. And all of the blood and treasure we sacrificed, made the Middle East, really it’s less safe, it’s less stable, and it’s less secure. And I say it all the time. The single greatest mistake our country made in its history was going in to the quicksand of the Middle East. We spent $8 trillion and lost thousands of lives. And by the way, the other side, we can talk about that, lost millions of lives. What did we do?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","01:42:23"
"Donald Trump","So we’re going to pull them out, and we’re pulling people out, and we’re trying to make good deals, and we’re going to bring our soldiers back home, and we may need them for something else, and they’ll be ready. Previous administrations lust for regime change, and also put historic Christian communities in vastly more danger than they were before we started. They are some of the biggest victims of these power vacuums and reckless foreign adventures. The Christians, the Christians. And we work hard with the Christians. We have tremendous evangelical support. We work hard with the Christians.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","01:43:27"
"Donald Trump","So we’re slowly getting out of the Middle East. We’re doing it carefully. And we’re rebuilding our military like we have never rebuilt our military before. When I came into office, a very prominent general told me, because it looked like we could have a big conflict with someone, said, “Sir, we have no ammunition.” We had old planes. We had planes that were so old, they didn’t fly. We had people going to the desert, the plane graveyards, airplane graveyards, picking up parts. I never want to hear a President of the United States hear those words again. I never want to have a President hear the words, “Sir, we have no ammunition.” Think of that. Think of that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","01:44:13"
"Donald Trump","Now, thanks to more than two and a half trillion dollar worth of investment in our military, we have more ammunition, more missiles, more rockets, more tanks, more fighter jets, and more of everything else than we’ve ever had before. And we have no choice. You look around the world, and we have no choice, unfortunately. And the Democrats want to dismantle our military. After years of building up other countries, we are finally building up our country. That’s what we have to do.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","01:45:06"
"Donald Trump","We’re replacing the disaster known as NAFTA with the brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, USMCA, a giant victory for our farmers, ranchers, workers in Minnesota. Congress should pass USMCA immediately. We hope that Nancy Pelosi can start thinking about passing some legislation instead of thinking about nonsense.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","01:45:50"
"Donald Trump","And to protect our industrial backbone, I placed tariffs on foreign aluminum and foreign steel. I’m also fighting back against years of chronic trade abuse from China. And the supply chain of China, which was unbreakable, is now breaking wide open. And they understand that. And I don’t blame China for what’s taken place over the last 25 years. I blame the people that led our country that let that happen, where hundreds of billions of dollars a year was taken from our country to build China. It’s not China’s fault.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","01:46:18"
"Donald Trump","In the previous administration, they put our nation’s natural resources under lock and key, including thousands and thousands of acres in a place called Superior National Forest. Last year, I traveled to Duluth and announced that we would be ending this injustice, reopening Superior National Forest, and restoring mineral exploration for the iron ore mines of Minnesota. Tremendous jobs. And now the iron range is back in business. The last time I was here, a man came up to me, he said, “Sir, President Obama took our heart away, took our life away.’ I’ll never forget it. A man, strong guy, had tears in his eyes. He said, “You gave us back our life,” because they took it away from him. We gave it back. Best iron ore there is anywhere.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","01:47:05"
"Donald Trump","My administration is also fighting the Democrat socialist healthcare agenda that would obliterate Medicare. Republicans will protect Medicare, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. And for those of you that have private healthcare, health insurance, 180 million people, they are going to end it, obliterate it, and most people are thrilled with it. We are going to leave it. You’re going to have your plan the way you want it. And there’s no plan like those plans.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","01:48:16"
"Donald Trump","Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother’s womb, right up to the moment of birth. That is why I’ve asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant Washington corruption. The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and it’s the party of the American Dream.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","01:48:56"
"Donald Trump","For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. You remember that? Gee, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. Now you have a President who’s standing up for America, we are standing up for Minneapolis, and we are standing up for the great state of Minnesota.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-minnesota-rally-speech-transcript-minneapolis-mn-rally-october-10-2019","Donald Trump Minnesota Rally Speech Transcript: Minneapolis, MN Rally October 10, 2019","01:49:58"
"Donald Trump","We begin this political campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for America.

"Donald Trump","With your help, we will reelect, and we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and lawful system of immigration. We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer, and ending the AIDS epidemic in America within 10 years. Nobody thought that could be done. Going to be done. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement.

And we live by the words of our great national motto, In God We Trust. We stand on the shoulders of American Patriots who built this country into the greatest nation ever to exist in history. Our ancestors crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, revolutionized industry, pioneered science, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and put a man on the face of the moon.
