"Donald Trump","Wow. That’s so great. I want to start off by saying a very big hello, Wisconsin. It’s great to be with you. And I’ll also say this. I have never spoken where I had so many people behind me. I have a whole stadium behind. I want to just thank everybody. This is a great turnout. They wanted a bigger space. They got a bigger space. Because seven days from now, we are going to win this state and we are going to four more incredible years in the White House. Thank you. This election is a choice between a Trump super recovery or a Biden depression. That’s what you’re going to have with the raise of taxes, the biggest tax increase in our history. It’s ridiculous. It’s a choice between a Trump boom or a Biden lockdown. Let’s lock it all down. And by the way, speaking of lockdowns, let’s get your governor to open it up. Let’s get him to open it up.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-west-salem-wisconsin-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript West Salem, Wisconsin October 27","02:01"
"Donald Trump","It’s a choice between our plan to cut your taxes or even, and I have to tell you, we’ve given you the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. You know that, biggest regulation cut in the history of our country. And sleepy Joe Biden, his plan is to raise your taxes at a level that our country has never raised taxes before. Somehow that doesn’t work too well. Do you agree? I don’t think so. I don’t think so. I’ve never heard of it before, but that’s okay. You can’t hear of everything, right? All my life I’ve watched people want to cut taxes. Here’s a guy, he’s running on a basis of let’s raise everybody’s taxes.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-west-salem-wisconsin-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript West Salem, Wisconsin October 27","03:12"
"Donald Trump","Next week, Wisconsin is going to answer the call of history once again. We had a great victory here. Didn’t we have a great? Remember that four years ago? They said, “Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin.” It’s been a long time since a Republican did that, but we’re actually much higher now than we were then. We have a campaign that’s actually more enthusiastic. And that was, I would say, that had to be number one in history four years ago. But you know what? This is going to be the most important election in the history of our country. Because you see what’s happening, the radical lefts, and you’re going to defeat Biden and dark money donors and corrupt special interests. One of the most important issues in this election is law and order. We say it. Law and order.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-west-salem-wisconsin-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript West Salem, Wisconsin October 27","03:55"
"Donald Trump","Joe Biden is party incite violence and hatred against our police officers. And we’re not doing that. No, we’re not doing that. Remember the debate, the first debate. Which one did you like better, the first one or the second one? He says, “Both.” That’s a fan. He said, “My man is there.” Yeah. Did anybody see the last one? Anybody watching? Seems to have had a very big impact. We learned a lot about him. Number one, he’s against oil, gas, probably likes wind, but wind is very intermittent. Let’s watch the President tonight on television. I’m sorry, darling, the wind’s not blowing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-west-salem-wisconsin-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript West Salem, Wisconsin October 27","04:48"
"Donald Trump","Last night, Philadelphia was torn up by Biden supporting radicals. 30 police officers, Philadelphia police officers, great people, they were injured, some badly. Biden stands with the riders and I stand with the heroes of law enforcement. And you know what? They can do their job very easily. Just let them do their job. The Biden Harris plan would end cash bail. You know, they want to have cash bail so everyone just walks around. No matter what they do, ends cash bail, free 400,000 dangerous criminals. It would slash police budgets all over the country. It would tie the hands of every police officer in the country and they would appoint anti-police prosecutors in every community in America. I don’t think that’s for Wisconsin. We know each other well.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-west-salem-wisconsin-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript West Salem, Wisconsin October 27","05:31"
"Donald Trump","Biden is soft and weak and too scared to be President. He doesn’t want to be President. Let’s face it. You know, you got his bad body language there. This man knows body language better than any man I know. That’s a lot of bad body language from Joe. You know, he got out yesterday. You saw that? Because we’re making speeches all over Pennsylvania. He got out and he got out of Delaware and he said, “What’s the closest point to Pennsylvania?” And it was just a few minutes from his basement. And he went and made a speech. And that was a mistake because they had to take him off the stage because he didn’t know where the hell he was. Right? That didn’t work out too well. No, because he had a lid, you know, like a garbage can. You put it in the can. It’s a lid. It’s called a lid. But he doesn’t want to be President. One thing about this job, you got to want it. You got to want it. This is tough. This is tough.

"Donald Trump","And unlike Biden, who’s made a fortune in politics, what a fortune. The press is not allowed to write about that though. But Biden made a fortune. You know what? This is costing me billions of dollars. And you know, I could not be happier because we have done things that nobody else could have done in the first three and a half years. There’s been no administration that’s done what we’ve done in the first three and a half years with our military, with our vets, with regulations, with cutting taxes. Biden’s running mate, the most liberal member in the U.S. Senate. She makes Bernie Sanders look like he’s a conservative. Even urge their supporters to donate to a fund to bail out writers in Minneapolis, where they had such problems until the National Guard went in and they stopped it. Would you say that was about, what, 22 minutes? It was all over.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-west-salem-wisconsin-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript West Salem, Wisconsin October 27","07:48"
"Donald Trump","Including an attempted cop killer, they wanted to bail him out. The policies will set cop killers free. We believe if you murder a police officer, you should get the death penalty. And I know you’re a state that believes. You murder a police officer. You saw a month ago. The two young officers sitting in a car and the guy comes up. No, you do that stuff and you can’t get away with it. When the violent mob came to Kenosha, you know, Kenosha? Everybody know Kenosha? Biden opposed sending in the National Guard. We sent in the National Guard and we saved Kenosha. We save Kenosha. Kenosha wouldn’t be standing. And I got a lot of credit. Thank you to the sheriff and so many others for their support. They’ve actually came out and supported me. Thank you very much. Where’s the sheriff? Is he around here some place? What a hell of a sheriff. Thank you very much. That’s great. I appreciate it, too.

"Donald Trump","Biden has not only declared war on police. I mean, you know, it really is. My father taught me a long time. Don’t use the word cops because the word cops, that’s a little slang. Always call them police. So I never used it. You know, I see cops, but sometimes it’s not bad. Sheriff, let me ask you. Cops or police or doesn’t it matter? If it’s done with the heart, who cares, right? Right? If it’s done with a heart.

I’ll tell you what, they got a glimpse on four years ago. And remember they said, “Where did these people come from? Where did they come from?” They’re great Americans. They don’t want anything. They just want that level playing field. And they came out and they voted. And this is going to be bigger. This is going to be bigger. And they know it. They know it. They know it.

It’s messed up like you wouldn’t believe. Now they say, “We’d like to get the ballots and maybe get them within a few days of the election. And we’ll take 10 days to count them up.” Oh good. Let’s let the whole world wait while you count your ballots. And you know what happens while they’re counting them? They’re dumping more ballots in there. Okay? Where did they come from? No. We had a great ruling right here. We had a great ruling. Right? Got that yesterday. Supreme Court said, “Nope, that’s your date. That’s the [inaudible 00:00:12:14]. November 3rd.

Countries, most of you, including even most of the people, they never even heard of these countries. We’re bringing them all back home. You know that, right? They’re all coming back home. Afghanistan, Iraq, keeping some in Syria. If you don’t mind, we’re keeping the oil. You know, they should have done that with Iraq. Remember I said, “Don’t go into Iraq.

He’s a shill in a sense for foreign countries. You got to take a look at this guy’s record. Of course, right now he has no idea where he is, so that’s an entirely different problem.

The Democrat party was so against it, they said it was obsolete. Used drones so we can watch everybody pour into the border. Right? Let’s send a drone up there, right? Walls and wheels, right? Walls and wheels never get obsolete. That’s about the only two things I know of that don’t get obsolete. Everything else is obsolete about 15 minutes after you figure it out.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-west-salem-wisconsin-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript West Salem, Wisconsin October 27","23:46"

We will deliver record prosperity, epic job growth at a safe vaccine that eradicates the virus and quickly ends this pandemic. And you know with the fake news, everything is COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID. I had it. Here I am, right? Now. I had it. The First Lady had it Barron had it, but Barron had it for about 12 seconds.

It’s a whole crazy thing. I mean, it’s too complicated to explain. These people are very corrupt, very dishonest, but they’ve got a lot of problems. On November 4th, you’ll hear we’re doing extremely well and you’ll see. You’ll see. They used to always say that Europe, look at Europe, look at Europe. Well, first of all, they count their cases totally differently, but look at Europe. Well, they have a big spike and you know what? It’s going to go down and we had a spike in Miami.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-west-salem-wisconsin-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript West Salem, Wisconsin October 27","24:51"

You watch. They’ll stop talking. You get out that red wave, just get out. We have to win this election. This is the most important election we’ve ever had. We can’t let this radical left socialist group take over. And I’ve been saying it now for a long time, because I see it. There’s this inclination by a group of people, our country will never be a socialist nation.

Best numbers we’ve ever had. And next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. You see what’s happening. You see how it’s being built up. And by the way, I’d love to do stimulus, but Crazy Nancy doesn’t want to do it.

"Donald Trump","And I spoke for Wisconsin when I said, “No, thank you, Nancy. Have a good time.” We’ll get big stimulus right after the election’s over. Hopefully we can take back the House too. It’ll be nice. Get rid of her. Get rid of her as speaker. We’ll get Kevin there and Kevin would be good. You know who Kevin is? Kevin McCarthy. If Biden and the Democrat socialists are elected, you know what’s going on with your regulations? I’ve got your regulations down to a level, but we can go further. We have statutory requirements.

But it can be started again and destroy the suburbs beyond repair. Suburban women, you’re going to love me. You better love me. Did you see 60 minutes the other night? I always joke. I say “Suburban women, I’m getting rid of the regulation.” You know there’s a regulation that essentially destroyed the suburbs. Okay?

We deal with some real beauties, but we had a regulation where they can build low-income housing and projects in a neighborhood near you. Right in the neighborhood near you in the suburbs. Right? So the fake news was saying, “We think that Donald Trump is having problems with suburban women.” I said, “Why? Because I’m going to stop crime from going to the suburbs?” Because you know Antifa and the anarchists, they view the suburbs is next. That’s what they would like. Right? So the suburban woman wants law and order, they want safety and they don’t want a regulation that’s going to destroy the suburbs.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-west-salem-wisconsin-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript West Salem, Wisconsin October 27","28:04"

They said, “Women will not be voting for Donald Trump.” And then after about four hours and they declared total victory for Trump, they said, “He cannot get to 270. He cannot.” This was in the afternoon and for about six months before that, by the way. Didn’t just start. “Donald Trump cannot get.” You need 270, right? “Cannot get to 270.

We’re leading by three points. That’s good. They won’t report that. They won’t report that. They’ll look at 30 polls. They’ll look at 30 polls. Some of them are totally fixed. Some of them are sickos, right? They look at polls where they interview 38% Democrats, 21% Republicans.

"Donald Trump","When they’re doing 38 to 21. That means I’m winning in a landslide. What kind of polls are these? No, seriously. What kinds of polls are these? These people are crazy. Joe Biden will delay the vaccine, postpone therapies, prolong the pandemic, shutter your schools. Open your schools, please. Bankrupt your small businesses, and shut down our country. He will destroy our country. And by the way, the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. I said that a long time ago. Except when I originally said. I had no… I felt it. I felt it was bad. I just felt it was an instinct. It can’t be worse than the problem itself. So the shutdown, with alcoholism, with drugs, with abuse, with suicides, with all the things that happen, it’s worse. You can’t do this. You’ve got to get your governors to open up. There aren’t many of them. There aren’t many of them there aren’t many of them now, but you’ve got to… One of the reasons, this is another one.

"Donald Trump","They’ll be announcing, “We’re opening our state.” One of them, stupidly, like three weeks ago announced, “Yeah, we think we’re going to open probably around November 4th.” How about that genius? You’ll all be open around a couple of days after the election. Biden even wants to lock down young and healthy Americans, yet for those under age 50 the recovery rate is 99.98%. Think of that. 99. 98%. And for school kids it’s better than that. Biden’s cruel and senseless lockdowns would cause countless deaths from suicide and from all of the problems we have, and we would have problems. And economic, people lose their jobs. They lose their jobs, their small businesses go out or they work for small businesses or big businesses that go out. We’ve got to open up our states. We’ve got to tell your governor, we got to open up our states. Does anybody like your governor? Do you like him? Okay, let’s have a… Who likes the governor?

You know Michigan, the only one that it was allowed to go around and roam was her husband. He was allowed to go fishing and sailing. Nobody else was, they had to stay locked up in their house. But we won a Supreme Court case against them. They found it unconstitutional that she locked down the state of Michigan. I just left Michigan.

I won’t put on a hat and I’ll just stand there in the rain and I’ll freeze and I’ll make a speech.” But I’ll tell, you there was such love. It was incredible. We’re winning Michigan, too. We’re winning Michigan. I had a nice hat on, I was going to put it on. And they were waiting for four or five hours. I said, “I feel so guilty.” I was on time, but they get there very early, like probably some of you. You got here very early. All these front rowers I know got here. I know the front rowers get here very early. We have it where they get three, four days in advance. Were you here three, four days?

We’ve never had… And four years ago we had the most enthusiastic campaign anyone’s ever seen, probably there ever was this. This campaign, and I never thought I’d say it, has more enthusiasm, more support than we did four years ago, because four years ago I was a business guy. I was successful, I was very successful.

They’re moving to Mexico, they’re making it in China, they’re doing all these things. A lot of places moved up to Canada. Canada was very tough on us. And I saw this, that’s probably the main reason I ran. But I saw it all happening. It was so easy to see. I saw it all happening, and that’s probably the main reason I ran. But four years ago I was just saying, “I’m going to cut your taxes. I’m going to cut regulations. I’m going to rebuild your military. I’m going to do all the things I said.” And actually I did more, because Space Force.

"Donald Trump","I never said I was going to do that. I learned that after watching Russia and China and everything else. I learned that after I was here. One of these people right back there said, “He may be the only politician that actually did more than he promised during the campaign.” I believe that’s true. So we have actually more enthusiasm because I did everything. I said the wall. The wall was just very expensive. The border patrol wanted a certain way, very expensive. They’re right, they wanted vision, they wanted steel, they wanted rebar, they wanted concrete inside. And I said, “You know what? I’ll do it. I want to do it the way you want it. I don’t want to give you any excuses for doing a bad job on the border.” Gee, if you only would’ve built the wall right. But all of the things that I said, I did.

"Donald Trump","And that gives this campaign more energy than a guy that was successful that said, “Hey, I’m going to do a lot of things.” Because you’ve been hearing that for years from politicians, and they don’t do it. They don’t get the job. As I said about Biden the other night at the debate, “Joe, you’re all talk and no action.” And it’s true. And I’d looked at him and I’d say, “Joe, why didn’t you do it?” He’d say, “Well, we should’ve done this. We should’ve done that.” I said, “Joe, you’ve been there for 47 years and you left three and a half years ago. It’s not like you left 30 years ago. You left three and a half years ago. And I only ran because of you, Joe. Because if you and Obama did a good job I wouldn’t have run, there would’ve been no reason.

He’s going to lock it up. If one guy walks up and says, “Sir, I think we should close up our country.” “Okay, that sounds good to me.” While letting rioters and looters run wild, or as Joe calls them peaceful protestors. I call you protesters. You know why? Because there’s a legal definition. You can’t have a political rally. They did that to keep me out. So I said, “Oh I see, you’re protesters.” The only thing you can do is protest, because they wanted to protect anarchists, rioters people that were burning down your stores. So you have the absolute right to protest. So I call this a friendly protest, okay? Officially. Not a rally. This is not a rally, it’s a friendly protest. Okay, now we’ve gotten over the legal hurdle, haven’t we? These people don’t believe in science.

We have that kind of potential. We have the foundation set. You see what’s happening, you see the kind of numbers we’re doing. We’re going to make our country more successful, quickly, than it’s ever been. When the China plague arrived we moved heaven and earth to fight the disease. We airlifted medical supplies, pioneered groundbreaking therapies, reduced the fatality rate 85%. Think of that. 85%. And now it’s actually higher than that. Well, here I am. I’m here, right? I said, “Give me that stuff. Whatever the hell it is, doctor, I want it.” The next day I woke up and I felt like Superman. I said, “Get me the hell out of here.

It should’ve never been allowed to leave China, ever. It should have never been allowed. Once it got Wuhan, Wuhan province, it never got out, but it came to the USA and Europe and the rest of the world. I’m working to make the breakthrough treatment I received, so what we’re doing is we’re going to make the Regeneron and Eli Lilly, a great company, has a similar antibody drug. And we’re going to make that available to people that need it, free. All I know is I didn’t feel great.

We have the vaccine. We’re going to have it very soon. Very soon. We’re going to deliver it. But without it, also, we’re rounding the curve, we’re rounding the corner. It’s happening. We’re going to emerge stronger than ever before. Biden’s made a corrupt bargain, and the Democrats. In exchange for his party’s nomination he is handed control of his party over to a rage-filled socialists and Marxists and the left wing extremists. You see it in Portland. How about Portland? We could solve that problem in I’d say a half an hour. Anarchists, you know what happens to them, right? They go back home to mom and dad.

We’re at least two or three points up. Doesn’t sound like much. You know what happens with us? They’ll say, “He’s three points up,” and then you win by like 10. Got a lot of hidden votes out there. I don’t know if I’m supposed to be complimented by that and not, but there are hidden votes. They don’t want to talk. They are all action, they call that all action. If Biden wins, the flag burning radicals on the streets will be running for… You know that. They’ll be running your government, there’ll be running your government.

Father becomes vice-president, he becomes in charge of Ukraine. Son goes on the board of Barisma. Goes on the board of Barisma, $183,000 a month. Would you say that’s good? Would you say that’s good?

You catch them and you have to release them into the United States. Then within two or three years they’re supposed to come back for a trial. We had an argument during the debate. I said, “Sleepy Joe, they don’t come back.” “Yes they do. They proudly come back.” No, no, Joe. They’re murderers. They don’t come back Joe. I turned out to be right, but you know.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-west-salem-wisconsin-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript West Salem, Wisconsin October 27","48:43"
"Donald Trump","He would make every community into a sanctuary city for violent criminals. We invested $2.5 trillion in the U.S. military. You know that, right? You are a big beneficiary this state. A lot of business in this state, including nearly $6 billion to save the historic shipyard, Marinette Marine. You know that, right? And they’re great. I was there four or five months ago. I was watching. They build beautiful, beautiful … It looks like a yacht with lots of weapons on it. The only difference is you got rockets all over the damn thing, but it is beautiful.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-west-salem-wisconsin-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript West Salem, Wisconsin October 27","49:21"
"Donald Trump","We killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. We took out the world’s number one terrorist. Soleimani is dead. We took out 100% of the ISIS caliphate [inaudible 00:05:12]. When I took over it was a mess. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal, $150 billion, 1.8 billion in cash. You know what we got? Nothing. I recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. Instead of never-ending wars, we are forging peace in the Middle East. We’re doing it. It’s like working out really well. Three countries already, and many are lined up. They’re all wanting to get in.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-west-salem-wisconsin-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript West Salem, Wisconsin October 27","49:56"
"Donald Trump","A vote for Republicans is a vote for the American Dream. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln. It’s a vote for the American Dream. In conclusion, over the next four years we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. It’s already happening. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States, right here in Wisconsin. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. You don’t want the sanctuary cities.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-west-salem-wisconsin-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript West Salem, Wisconsin October 27","50:49"
"Donald Trump","We will defend the right to life, religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. It’s very important. Supreme Court, you got to do that. You got to remember. A lot of people think that’s why I got elected because of the Supreme Court. And we’ve got already three great justices and Amy yesterday. By the end of the first term we’ll have close to three, maybe more, but approximately 300 federal judges, including court of appeals judges. A record. It’s a record.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-west-salem-wisconsin-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript West Salem, Wisconsin October 27","51:32"
"Donald Trump","We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. So the two-and-a-half trillion dollars, the greatest rockets and missiles, hydrosonic. The greatest in the world. They go seven times faster than what we have today. We have tanks. We have planes. We have bombers. We have submarines. We’ve rebuilt our military. We have the greatest equipment, the greatest military force in the world. Russia, China, everybody, they are envious. Nobody thought we could do this, and we’ve done it all. A lot of it’s made right here, but all made in the USA. All made in the USA. Our nuclear is now in tippy-top shape, and just hope, just hope, that we never have to use it. That’s all.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-west-salem-wisconsin-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript West Salem, Wisconsin October 27","52:10"
"Donald Trump","We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. Already signed. January 1st it goes into effect. Lower drug prices even further, favored nations. Nobody can believe I did it, and we’re going to get the lowest prices in the world. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. NASA right now is the talk of the world as a space center. Again, it was closed and a mess when I took over. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God We Trust. Right? For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Wisconsin. That’s what we’re doing. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your coworkers, even grab your boss if you have to. Come on boss, you got to go out and get out and vote. You got to get out and vote. Got to get out. This is a thing you got to do. Just remember the great red wave. It’s now just starting to form, and they know it’s coming. They know it’s coming. We didn’t come this far and fight this hard to surrender our country back to the corrupt Washington swamp.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-west-salem-wisconsin-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript West Salem, Wisconsin October 27","53:10"
"Donald Trump","On November 3rd we must finish the job, drain the swamp. Go out and vote. Could be before November 3rd. Go out and vote. From Green Bay to La Crosse, from Madison to Milwaukee, and from Janesville to right here in West Salem, we inherit the legacy of red-blooded American patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty and defend our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated Fascism and Communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And the best is yet to come.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-west-salem-wisconsin-october-27","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript West Salem, Wisconsin October 27","55:08"
"Donald Trump","Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of Wisconsin we have made America powerful again. We have made America wealthy again. We have America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you Wisconsin.
