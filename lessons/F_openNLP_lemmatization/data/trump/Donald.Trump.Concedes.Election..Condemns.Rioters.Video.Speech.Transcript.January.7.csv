"Donald Trump","I would like to begin by addressing the heinous attack on the United States Capitol. Like all Americans, I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem. I immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders. America is and must always be a nation of law and order.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-concedes-election-condemns-rioters-video-transcript-january-7","Donald Trump Concedes Election, Condemns Rioters Video Speech Transcript January 7","00:00"
"Donald Trump","The demonstrators who infiltrated the Capitol have defiled the seat of American democracy. To those who engaged in the acts of violence and destruction, you do not represent our country. And to those who broke the law, you will pay. We have just been through an intense election and emotions are high, but now tempers must be cooled and calm restored. We must get on with the business of America.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-concedes-election-condemns-rioters-video-transcript-january-7","Donald Trump Concedes Election, Condemns Rioters Video Speech Transcript January 7","00:25"
"Donald Trump","My campaign vigorously pursued every legal avenue to contest the election results. My only goal was to ensure the integrity of the vote.

"Donald Trump","This moment calls for healing and reconciliation. 2020 has been a challenging time for our people. A menacing pandemic has upended the lives of our citizens, isolated millions in their homes, damaged our economy, and claimed countless lives. Defeating this pandemic and rebuilding the greatest economy on earth will require all of us working together. It will require a renewed emphasis on the civic values of patriotism, faith, charity, community, and family. We must revitalize the sacred bonds of love and loyalty that bind us together as one national family.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-concedes-election-condemns-rioters-video-transcript-january-7","Donald Trump Concedes Election, Condemns Rioters Video Speech Transcript January 7","01:38"
