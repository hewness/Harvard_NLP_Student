"Donald Trump","We had a very good decision in the John Bolton book case. The judge was very powerful in his statements on classified information and very powerful also the fact that the country will get the money, any money he makes. I hope a lot of books … Well, I probably don’t hope that, but whatever he makes, he’s going to be giving back. In my opinion, based by the ruling, he’s got to be giving back.

Obviously, the book was already out.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-to-media-about-bolton-book-berman-firing","Donald Trump Speaks to Media About Bolton Book, Berman Firing","00:00"
