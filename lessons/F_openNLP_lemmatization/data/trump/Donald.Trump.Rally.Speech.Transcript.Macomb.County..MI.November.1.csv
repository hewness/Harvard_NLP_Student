"Ivanka Trump","I recently read a quote that I thought was so amazing by the legendary Winston Churchill. He said, “It was a nation that had the lion’s heart. I just had the luck to give it its roar.” How much does that remind you of our President and this movement? Did he give all of us the roar? Yes, he did. He made all of us take a hard look at our own convictions and ask ourselves, what do we want for our country? We want jobs. We want opportunity. We want to believe in American greatness, and that’s what’s on the ballot. With your help, with your support, and with your votes in two days from now, we are going to win four more years for the people’s president, my father, Donald J. Trump. Thank you, and God bless you. God bless Michigan.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-macomb-county-mi-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Macomb County, MI November 1","00:11"

"Donald Trump","Over the last four years, I fought for Michigan like no one has ever fought for Michigan. Before I became president, the great state of Michigan was hemorrhaging your car companies, and your car businesses. And thanks to corrupt politicians like Joe Biden, he’s turned out to be a corrupt politician, he is corrupt. Plants were closing and moving to Mexico and many other places, you know that, you know that better than anybody. There had no new plants had been built in Michigan in decades and decades before I got here. I stopped the moves, and now many plants are being built and already have been built. Plants are being expanded. The automobile business is coming back.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-macomb-county-mi-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Macomb County, MI November 1","05:06"
"Donald Trump","I told countries, Japan, Germany, and others, “Sorry, you have to bring it into our country.” And I always used to say like, “Michigan, I think of Michigan when I think of cars,” and I’d say, “Michigan,” but I’d say, “Ohio,” and I’d say, “South Carolina,” and plenty the other places, and we’ve brought back millions of car and millions of cars produced a year.

I’m with your vote we will continue to bring you jobs back, to enact fair trade, you saw what we’ve done, but think of all the plants, just forget about everything else. You didn’t have any auto plants four years ago. I got Man of the Year in Michigan, 12 years ago and I left, I said, I made a speech, I said, “You know, Mexico and Canada, they’re taking all your car business.

I laugh, I’m saying, “My people are geniuses, real geniuses.” But you know what? It turned out to be true. And since then we’ve been doing things like nobody’s ever done. Cut your taxes, cut your regulations, and ensure that more products are proudly stamped with those beautiful words, that beautiful phrase, “Made in the USA.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-macomb-county-mi-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Macomb County, MI November 1","07:41"

We had growth like nobody has ever seen in this country, or probably any other country, 33.1%. And they hardly, the fake news hardly makes it a story. But right now they don’t care, they’re just trying to survive. Look at them back there. They’re just trying to survive.

They’re going to go to the Green New Deal. The Green New Deal will destroy our country. The Green New Deal is done by AOC plus three, right? I don’t think they ever took, you think they ever took a course on the environment? I wonder? Did you ever have a course on, let’s say the environment? The Green New Deal… at first I thought they were kidding. Then they said, “You know, some…” Actually they are kidding, you know that? They get it, they get it, they’re kidding.

"Donald Trump","The women, that was them speaking; the women of the suburbs, you’ve got to love me, I got rid of the regulation that will ruin the suburbs. I cut it out. I said, “Let’s terminate it Ben, let’s just terminate it.” But if they come back, then Cory Booker is going to be in charge, and that regulation will not be good.

"Donald Trump","The damage that Biden and Harris would inflict would endure for many generations, you can’t fix it easy, you can’t fix it easy. Under my leadership our economy is now grow and get the fastest rate ever recorded, 33.1%. This was announced yesterday, right? It was just announced, they didn’t make a big deal out of it. If this were announced with Obama, they’d say, “This is the greatest president ever.” You know, he’s so great that he left me 142 judges to fill, right? 142.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-macomb-county-mi-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Macomb County, MI November 1","11:15"

This is a true test, but I love the people of Michigan, we won, we won. It’s worth it. It’s worth it. It’s worth it. It’s worth it. We won last time, right? It’s worth it. If we didn’t win last time, I probably wouldn’t even be standing here, I’d get up here and say, “No, thanks. This is [inaudible 00:12:59].” Like the great Pavarotti, the singer, you know, he was a diva, he was the greatest of all divas, he was an incredible talent with the most unbelievable voice. And I’ve gone to concerts where he would say, “No, no, no, no. I do not feel good, I will sing tonight,” and then he’d leave. And then I’ve gone to some where it was the most unbelievable voice that ever lived. I mean the greatest, right, Pavarotti? He liked me for whatever reason.

"Donald Trump","A recent Gallup poll found that 56% of Americans say they are better off today than they were four years ago under Obama-Biden. And we’re rounding the turn on a pandemic, think of that. So, and that’s a record. In my first three years, I raised middle-class family incomes $6,500. That was in a three-year period. Whereas the Biden-Harris agenda was projected, and is projected to, if you go by their crazy plan, Wall Street Journal, you’re going to lose $6,000. They’re going to take it out, and they’re going to waste it. But it’s not six, it’s much more than that. And we’re going up to a substantial number. That’s not including energy. And if you think about energy, when you’re at $2, and your electric bills are nice and low, when they get rid of all our petroleum products and other things, everything, and they go to wind; let’s build windmills all over the place, let’s litter the landscape, let’s have littered the lands…","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-macomb-county-mi-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Macomb County, MI November 1","14:12"

They used to say every 15, “Why don’t we just keep the old deal?” No, thank you. You don’t have to take my word for it on Biden’s 47 years of treachery and betrayal, we have it on tape.

We talk about China as our competitor, we should be helping. The idea that China is going to eat our lunch is bizarre.

They have no confidence in big tech and they’re tired, very tired, of cancel culture. They’re tired of being told what to think and what to do.

He openly called young black men “super predators.” In 1994, the Crime Bill, he devastated black families in places like Philadelphia, Atlanta, Milwaukee, Detroit. I reversed that injustice with a landmark criminal justice reform. And I’ll tell you, nobody else could have gotten it but me. We had a lot of help. Nobody else could have gotten… Obama never even tried. Nobody tried. Biden said that if black Americans don’t vote for him, you ain’t black, which is a famous, famous thing. But that’s not nearly as bad as other things he did. So, I have a message for every African-American voter in Michigan and across America. Tuesday is your chance to show Joe… And you know that, right? Tuesday is our big deal as a country. Show Joe Biden and the Democrat party what you think of their decades of betrayal and abuse.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-macomb-county-mi-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Macomb County, MI November 1","52:31"

"Donald Trump","Tuesday is your chance to show Joe Biden what you think of his decision to mistreat abuse and wrongly imprison So many African-Americans, and that’s what he did. That Crime Bill was a disgrace, and you know that’s what’s happening in Florida? So, we’re doing well with African-American… We’re doing very well, but a lot of them just aren’t showing up because they don’t want to vote for this guy. Typically, they vote Democrat. It’s changing a lot. It’s changing really fast.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-macomb-county-mi-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Macomb County, MI November 1","54:03"
"Donald Trump","And by the way, John James is a very good guy. I hope you’re going to be voting for him. John James, a very good guy. And he’s running against the guy… Nobody even knows who he is, Peters. I was there three years. I said, “Who’s Peters?” “Oh, he’s a Senator. He’s a Senator from Michigan.” Nobody knows who Peters is. He does nothing. He’s a puppet for Schumer. No, you should vote John James. He’s a great young guy. The great young man, West Point, a great military background, did well in business, and he wants to do this, and he’s doing us a favor. I think he could be a star. And I hope Michigan goes for John James.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-macomb-county-mi-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Macomb County, MI November 1","54:33"
"Donald Trump","To every black American, I’m asking you for your vote. I’m asking you to send a message to the corrupt Democrat establishment, that it is corrupt. We welcome you to the Republican party. By the way, it happens to be the party of the late, great Abraham Lincoln, right? Can’t do better than that. Under our platinum plan, you heard about that, we’ll create three million new jobs for black Americans, increase access to capital, and deliver school choice to every family [inaudible 00:55:50]. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military. We also passed VA Choice and VA Accountability, which is incredible for our great veterans.

"Donald Trump","We killed the leader of ISIS. You that who that is? Al-Baghdadi. They’ve been looking for him for long time. We took out the mass murder of US troops, and many other troops, and many other people, Soleimani is dead also. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal. I recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years, they worked on that. I got it done in two hours. And instead of endless war in the Middle East, peace is breaking out. Countries are lined up. They’re all lined up. We’re signing them one by one.

He thinks he’s a tough guy. Remember what he said a year ago? “I’d like to take him behind the bar.” You know what? Boom. I didn’t even have to close. I just, ding, he’s gone. He’s a tough guy, right? With his sunglasses. His new deal is his sunglasses. His new deal are those sunglasses. He was very agitated, right? See him just [inaudible 00:57:49]. And then, you’d have two cars honks. Honk, honk. We have more in the 10 feet of the front row than he had yesterday. And I hate to say it, Obama doesn’t draw any better.
