I say it because there they are, just very dishonest people. Very dishonest. To vote for me, is a vote for massive middle class tax cuts, regulation cuts, fair trade, strong borders and American energy independence. It’s a vote to support our police, support our military, defend our Second Amendment, which is siege, stand up to China and ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase.

It’s a powerful party and the party is totally joined with a fake news radio, the lame stream media right there. They’re totally joined with the big tech. I don’t know. Section 230. Does anyone know what Section 230? You do. Section 230, I think wha? Tremendous corruption on behalf of the Biden. Tremendous.

They’ll give you 25 things I’ve done over my life. They make it negative, always negative trending. But Sleepy Joe Biden, with all the corruption, all the theft, all the money they took out of these countries, that we end up paying for in spades. You can’t find it on big tech and you can’t find it at the Washington Post, the New York Times, because they’re crooked, they’re dishonest, and we caught him.

Just so you understand. I’ll say it, because I’ve said, “Hey, I’ve seen enough. I’ve seen enough. Here’s a guy, gets caught and the media doesn’t want to write about it.” You know what? They call it? Not freedom of the press, suppression of the press. We don’t have freedom of the press. You know what? We don’t have … you understand that? We don’t have freedom of the press.

His people grabbed him, “Get him off, get him off.” He’s trying to make it to the finish line. I mean, it’s honestly, it’s a disgrace. The whole thing is a con job. He should have never been the candidate. You know what? They have a corrupt party and all of this work being done by big tech and being done by the media, that should be considered a major, massive, billion dollar campaign contribution because that’s what it is. They slashed Medicare and Social Security.

They tell him, “Joe, you have to change.” “Okay. What do you want to say?” “I love fracking. Say, I love.” He goes from no fracking, to I love fracking. A vote for Sleepy Joe Biden is a vote for open borders, off-shoring jobs, shredding your Second Amendment, which is totally under siege, by the way.

You got a lot of ballots floating around in Nevada. Hey, you know, it’s windy as hell out here. I said, “Is it windy? Should I bring a hat?” Because, I don’t Love my hair flopping around.

I’ll do it, if you want. Otherwise … what a guy. Yes? Better? Nice hat. We’re going to change your hat. We made America great again. We created the greatest economy in the history of the world, and then we had the plague come in from China, and now we’re doing it again. Our numbers are unbelievable. By the way, you’re going to have a very big number. I even say, hold off in your vote until it happens, because a lot of you want to wait until Tuesday anyway, which is going to be a great, great red wave.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-bullhead-city-az-october-28","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Bullhead City, AZ October 28","10:19"

If that number is not big, you don’t even have to vote for me. Okay? I think it’s going to be, maybe, the biggest number in the history of our country. GDP. That’s your big number Right?

But whatever you do, you have to go out and vote. Who here, is going to vote for Sleepy Joe Biden. I had a leader of a country call up. He’s a very tough leader, tough as hell. They’re going to figure it out, maybe. Although they wouldn’t, if it was right, if it was good, they were not going to report it. He said, “I hope Biden doesn’t win because he’s always slipping.” That was an interesting thing he said.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-bullhead-city-az-october-28","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Bullhead City, AZ October 28","12:16"
"Donald Trump","This is a killer. Says, “I hope he doesn’t win, because he’s always sleeping.” Here. I thought he was being funny. I said. “You happen to be right about that.” This election is a choice between a Trump super-recovery and a Biden depression. You will have a depression, the likes of which you haven’t seen before, maybe 1929. He wants to raise your taxes, put regulations back on. Remember this. Get rid of your Second Amendment. Remember this. Remember this. Pro-life, anybody pro-life? There’s so many differences. This is the single biggest election, in my opinion, and I never thought I’d say it, in the history of our country.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-bullhead-city-az-october-28","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Bullhead City, AZ October 28","12:50"
"Donald Trump","This is the biggest. The biggest in the history of our country. It’s a choice between a Trump boom and a Biden lockdown. He’ll close it up. He’ll close it up. It’s really something. We talk about the American dream. We had the American dream. It was all coming together. There was going to be, believe it or not, unity. I was getting calls from people, you wouldn’t believe it, and then we had this thing can come in. It came in and it came in very … The invisible enemy came in and we went back to work and we saved 2 million people. It was going to be 2.2 million people. We say, maybe more than that, but it’s a choice between the American dream and a socialist nightmare. That’s what it is. The reason it’s such an important, is because, you’ve heard me say it many times, our country will never be a socialist country, and that’s where they want to take us.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-bullhead-city-az-october-28","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Bullhead City, AZ October 28","13:33"

Oh, they’re shocked. They don’t believe it. The polls with Hispanics are through the roof. They’re reporting on it. I said, “I never had a problem. I always liked Hispanic,” but they’re really, they’re getting to understand me and the incredible progress that we’ve made. The polls with Hispanic- Americans are the highest ever, in the history of our country for a Republican. But it could be that we’re going to top them, and once we top them, you’re going to forget about them because we’ve really gotten along. The poll, by the way, who saw the debate the other day?

I felt like Perry Mason, because he admitted right in the end, his last name. I said, “Does that mean you don’t like oil, Joe?”Ah, ah, well, ah, ah.” No, it’s Perry Mason. Do you ever watch? Colombo? How about Colombo? It’s the same thing. Right at the end, does that mean, oh did he blow it? They’ve been working for five days and then they had to go to Pennsylvania where fracking’s a big deal, right? How about Texas? You think they like him in Texas? No oil. Think of this. No oil, no guns. Second Amendment. No God, religion. Then I hear, Trump has a one point lead in Texas. I don’t think so.

To show you what I know, I said, “Oh, she used the word irredeemable about our people.” But it was deplorable that caught on. Right? But, whoever her speech-writer is, I don’t want him or her.

So we cancel rallies then I had the idea. I said, “Wait a minute. Let’s just go to protest.” We had a lot of people. We had a good time.

You cannot under any circumstances take it off. You have to eat through the mask. Right? Right, Charlie. It’s a very complex mechanism. And they don’t realize those germs, they go through it like nothing.

I’ll tell you what, the wall, they kept saying, the Democrats, “We don’t need a wall. We need drones.” Drones, all they want wanted, they talked about drones, so that we can watch thousands of people pour into our border. Actually, we’re all set. We have drones. We have such technology within this wall. We got exactly the wall that the Border Patrol wanted. I negotiated with them, but they didn’t want to talk about it. They wanted steel. They wanted concrete inside the steel. They wanted rebar inside the concrete. We got everything. And they wanted wires all over the place to hook up the technology.

His plan would completely obliterate so many of the things that you want. He would do things that you would never have, that you would never accept. He will do things that are so far left that we’re not going to talk about them today. He will do things that will destroy our country. This would trigger a tsunami of illegal immigration.
