Thank you. And we love this state. It’s been a great state for me and it’s been a great state for everybody in this room I can tell you Governor, right? And we’re here to help. We’re joined today by Governor Greg Abbott, very special man. And he’s doing a fantastic job for the state of Texas. And he has from day one and Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, another friend of mine. And thank you, Dan.

"Donald Trump","Well, thank you very much, Becky. I hear you’re doing a great job. And again, we were talking before about the path and the path could have been much more because the power was incredible. Louisiana took a very, very hard hit, but even Louisiana, if it was over just a little bit further, it would have been a record setting hit because the power was record-setting. It was at 185 and 175. It went to 150 miles an hour when it hit. But it was even worse than that. And it came quickly. It came very quickly. In fact, I guess you would say Pete, they were looking at that as a storm and all of a sudden the storm became a monster.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-speaks-in-orange-tx-with-ted-cruz-greg-abbott-august-29","Transcript: Donald Trump Speaks in Orange, TX with Ted Cruz & Greg Abbott August 29","03:29"

"Donald Trump","Yeah. It went from a storm to 185 and 175 miles an hour. And then when it hit, and I think they say it was the the strongest that they’ve had in Louisiana and Texas in 150 years, but the path was a little bit lucky. So we got a little bit lucky so that’s great. I want to also introduce Chad Wolf who, as you know, we just took the acting away from his name and you’re doing a fantastic job, Homeland Security, and hopefully Ted will be pushing that very hard and we’ll get him through quickly because he’s done a fantastic job.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-speaks-in-orange-tx-with-ted-cruz-greg-abbott-august-29","Transcript: Donald Trump Speaks in Orange, TX with Ted Cruz & Greg Abbott August 29","04:11"

"Donald Trump","Good. If he says it, that means it’s a good sign. That’s a good sign. And FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor, who’s been doing this with me for a long time and we haven’t had a loss yet. We haven’t had a loser. I’ll tell you we do it good and we do it fast and we get you back up and everything. I think Governor has been signed and you’re ready to go, right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-speaks-in-orange-tx-with-ted-cruz-greg-abbott-august-29","Transcript: Donald Trump Speaks in Orange, TX with Ted Cruz & Greg Abbott August 29","04:49"
"Greg Abbott","Yes. Yes.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-speaks-in-orange-tx-with-ted-cruz-greg-abbott-august-29","Transcript: Donald Trump Speaks in Orange, TX with Ted Cruz & Greg Abbott August 29","05:11"
"Donald Trump","You’re ready to go. I will dispense with all of the different numbers. You know what they are. We just sort of did it. We were in Louisiana and we went through and they have been hit hard. We went through a couple of areas. I’ve never seen anything quite like it. You had trees ripped out from the roots. You had pine trees that were broken in half, not even from there. And you just don’t see that kind of power. So we went through something that was pretty, pretty bad. I don’t think you got anything like that and that’s good. So we took the emergency declaration. We gave it to the governor immediately and Dan called about it also. And I appreciate that call and between the two of them, that’s a great one two punch. The governor told me that himself so I appreciate it. And FEMA has delivered 400,000 liters water and 250,000 meals already. We’ve worked with the private sector to restore power to remaining 200,000 residents.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-speaks-in-orange-tx-with-ted-cruz-greg-abbott-august-29","Transcript: Donald Trump Speaks in Orange, TX with Ted Cruz & Greg Abbott August 29","05:11"
"Donald Trump","And they think the power is going to be restored almost in very good order-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-speaks-in-orange-tx-with-ted-cruz-greg-abbott-august-29","Transcript: Donald Trump Speaks in Orange, TX with Ted Cruz & Greg Abbott August 29","06:07"

"Donald Trump","… I believe. Yeah, I believe so. And all of the other things that we’ve been doing, the infrastructure, all of the elements that we’ve been working on and we’re working very close with Ted Cruz and with John Cornyn, who I hear is doing very well by the way. I he’s a great senator. He’s doing a fantastic job. And we’ve been working with the governor and with Dan and I think maybe it’d be good if you would tell us how are we doing and what can we do and how can we help you Governor?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-speaks-in-orange-tx-with-ted-cruz-greg-abbott-august-29","Transcript: Donald Trump Speaks in Orange, TX with Ted Cruz & Greg Abbott August 29","06:11"
"Greg Abbott","Sure. First, I need to thank you for the way that you have stepped up. People don’t know this, but on midnight as the storm was crossing the shoreline you called me. And then so that was 1:00 AM your time. And then we spoke again the morning after it happened. You have been there for us every step of the way helping us. Never have I seen such a swift response to our request as we have received from Administrator Gaynor and we cannot thank you enough. I call him and it’s like he knows in advance I’m going to be calling him. And so he just says yes, immediately. And so of all the storms I’ve been through, which as you know, has been a lot, I’ve never received a swifter response from the administration. And so on behalf of everybody in this room and everybody across the state of Texas, we want to say thank you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-speaks-in-orange-tx-with-ted-cruz-greg-abbott-august-29","Transcript: Donald Trump Speaks in Orange, TX with Ted Cruz & Greg Abbott August 29","06:41"
"Greg Abbott","I want to thank the local officials, Judge Gothia in who’s county we’re in right now, we appreciate you and your leadership. The members of Congress, Becky, and the other mayors in the region. We appreciate everything you do. And of course, Nim Kidd. If I could share some details, I know you covered the details in Louisiana, just real quick. Now I have declared a disaster in 62 counties and the President has similarly declared a disaster in each of those counties. So on behalf of all of those 62 counties, we all say thank you, Mr. President, for that. Right now, our areas of focus are on power, water, points of distribution, safe return of evacuees, and damage assessment. On power and water restoration, peak power outages exceeded 350,000 locations across 35 counties. Current outages as of 9:00 AM this morning are about 120,000 locations in 23 counties, meaning that our emergency repair crews have quickly restored more than 250, I mean 230 of those power outage incidents.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-speaks-in-orange-tx-with-ted-cruz-greg-abbott-august-29","Transcript: Donald Trump Speaks in Orange, TX with Ted Cruz & Greg Abbott August 29","07:34"
"Greg Abbott","For drinking water assessments, 111 of 171 drinking water system assessments have been completed. 84 are operational, 26 systems are under boiled water notice. In addition to things like that, we have 19 points of distribution set up in the impacted region that are providing things like water, ice, MREs while their power and water systems remain inoperable. There were over 10,000 evacuees that are in shelters throughout the state and approximately 3,300 hotel rooms. Of the shelter residents, the Texas division of emergency management under Nim Kidd is tracking more than 2200 shelter residents who are from Louisiana. Very important is that more than 10,000 of those evacuees were in what’s called non congregate settings. What that means is they were in hotel rooms typically. That is so important because we had to respond to Hurricane Laura while also responding to COVID-19 and the best setting for someone who’s an evacuee from a hurricane is not in a large congregate setting, but in separate settings to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We succeeded in getting through Hurricane Hannah without the spread of COVID-19. I believe we will succeed in getting through Hurricane Laura without spreading COVID-19.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-speaks-in-orange-tx-with-ted-cruz-greg-abbott-august-29","Transcript: Donald Trump Speaks in Orange, TX with Ted Cruz & Greg Abbott August 29","08:43"
"Greg Abbott","…without spreading COVID-19. A total of 808 residents were returned on 43 buses with more missions scheduled for today, and 160 state buses are ready to assist the ongoing re-population efforts. Let’s see, that’s about it. We continue to assess damages throughout the region. We are on top of this because of the swift and effective leadership of chief Nim Kidd, but we are better capable and swifter in responding to this hurricane because of the way you and your administration so swiftly stepped up and helped out the people of Texas.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-speaks-in-orange-tx-with-ted-cruz-greg-abbott-august-29","Transcript: Donald Trump Speaks in Orange, TX with Ted Cruz & Greg Abbott August 29","10:01"
"Donald Trump","Well, thank you very much. Again, you’re doing a great job in every way. In fact, I noticed your COVID, you say COVID-19 many different names, at least 20 different names, right? But you go like COVID-19, that’s okay with me, at least for today. Generally, I call it something else. But you’re doing very well in that. You’re coming down very rapidly, Texas, and so is Florida, and so is Arizona. It’s been incredible. It’s down to its lowest numbers. So it’s really doing well. So, that’s prior to this and I like what you’re doing with respect to keeping people separated during this problem with the hurricane. Great job.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-speaks-in-orange-tx-with-ted-cruz-greg-abbott-august-29","Transcript: Donald Trump Speaks in Orange, TX with Ted Cruz & Greg Abbott August 29","10:45"

"Ted Cruz","Well, Mr. President, we appreciate your being down in Texas once again. And let me say something that I just told the FEMA administrator a few minutes ago, which is that the consistent report I’ve gotten from the governor, I’ve gotten from local officials, state officials is the responsiveness of the administration throughout this hurricane, has been extraordinary. In many ways, we had a blessing with this hurricane in that it could have been much, much worse. There was significant damage from this hurricane, but compared to what we’ve seen in the past, Texas could have gotten hit much worse. We obviously grieve that our neighbors in Louisiana took the brunt of this storm. And just as Louisiana stepped up and helped Texas, particularly with hurricane Harvey, but other hurricanes as well, we’re now stepping up to help our neighbors in Louisiana who are really suffering.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-speaks-in-orange-tx-with-ted-cruz-greg-abbott-august-29","Transcript: Donald Trump Speaks in Orange, TX with Ted Cruz & Greg Abbott August 29","11:28"
"Ted Cruz","But one of the things that’s really impressive also is just the level of coordination. You know, Mary [Aames 00:12:26] and I were laughing about how we’ve got an inadvertent and unfortunate expertise right now in that Texas has been through some major, major disasters. And what we see consistently is a degree of interaction between the city officials, the County officials, the state officials, the federal officials, where you don’t get bickering, you don’t get turf jockeying. You just get everyone working together. And as these disasters have come, you have reached out repeatedly. I still remember talking with you when hurricane Harvey was in the Gulf and I was in the [Lucchese 00:13:02] factory in El Paso.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-speaks-in-orange-tx-with-ted-cruz-greg-abbott-august-29","Transcript: Donald Trump Speaks in Orange, TX with Ted Cruz & Greg Abbott August 29","12:20"

"Ted Cruz","And you said then, and that was the case then and the case now, you said everything Texas needs, the federal government, the resources will be there. And thank you for that leadership. It’s important, and it’s a testament here to the strength and expertise of the Texans at this table, working with the federal government, that we minimize the damage as much as possible with a very dangerous storm.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-speaks-in-orange-tx-with-ted-cruz-greg-abbott-august-29","Transcript: Donald Trump Speaks in Orange, TX with Ted Cruz & Greg Abbott August 29","13:04"

I was going into the Texas house in 2008 when Ike hit, and I’ve never, never seen this kind of responsiveness from the federal government. It is a tenement to your leadership, Mr. President. So, thank you, thank you, thank you. And our great state people are here, too.

I want to, I want to thank the local officials and Texas mayors and County judges are the only ones with the authority to mandate an evacuation, and that’s a courageous decision to make and Mayor Spears, judge, for the work that you did that saved lives. The reason we have the low death count that we have, is because you took the evacuation orders in this storm and took them seriously. So thank you for doing that. To my governor and the state leaders here, thanks for giving us the authority and the funding to go do good work. And we try really hard at that. But from our regional administrator, Tony Robinson to administrator Gainer, to secretary of Wolf, thank you for the dedicated leadership. Mr. President, we’ve never had this quick answers.

"Donald Trump","Okay. The governor, when he called me, he said, “Could you do me a favor? Just one more favor. That’s all I want. It’s very small.” I said, “How much governor?” He said, “It’s not much. $10 billion.” I said, “$10 billion?” He said that would really do something with respect to this tremendous flooding every time you have a hurricane.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-speaks-in-orange-tx-with-ted-cruz-greg-abbott-august-29","Transcript: Donald Trump Speaks in Orange, TX with Ted Cruz & Greg Abbott August 29","24:01"

"Speaker 6","Congress has already directed 3.8 billion, and that was with strong bipartisan support and your support, and so that’s beginning construction of the coastal spine.

Also, I want to thank a Judge John Gothia, and somebody we didn’t mention, Joel Ardoin. He’s our Parks and Management coordinator.

"Greg Abbott","Just real quick. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality continues to monitor those both with regard to air quality and water quality. They have mobile units engaged to make sure they are going to be able to adequately go to all the impacted areas and do the monitoring and make sure that if there is any type of environmental situation, it will be swiftly contained.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-speaks-in-orange-tx-with-ted-cruz-greg-abbott-august-29","Transcript: Donald Trump Speaks in Orange, TX with Ted Cruz & Greg Abbott August 29","26:35"

"Speaker 9","Mr. President, I have a question on, this is obviously an important trip to visit these communities. Do you plan to visit Kenosha, Wisconsin as well, another community that’s obviously in pain?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-speaks-in-orange-tx-with-ted-cruz-greg-abbott-august-29","Transcript: Donald Trump Speaks in Orange, TX with Ted Cruz & Greg Abbott August 29","26:59"
"Donald Trump","Probably so. We’ve had tremendous success. As you know, we were finally able to get the go ahead from the local authorities to send in the National Guard. We sent in the National Guard, and within a few minutes of the guard, everybody cleared out, and it became safe. That was three days ago. We’ve had absolutely no problem from then. We sent in 1000 National Guard, and that’s not even a big force. We could clean out, as an example, Portland, we could fix Portland in, I would say, 45 minutes. The people in Portland should protest because the mayor doesn’t know what he’s doing. He has no clue. He doesn’t even have a clue. This has been going on for years in Portland. It’s now been going on 94 days. If he would call, or if they would ask, or if the governor would ask, we would have the National Guard there in a very short period of time. That would be cleaned out in a matter of literally minutes, and you’d have a safe Portland. It’s ridiculous that they go on like this.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-speaks-in-orange-tx-with-ted-cruz-greg-abbott-august-29","Transcript: Donald Trump Speaks in Orange, TX with Ted Cruz & Greg Abbott August 29","27:08"
"Donald Trump","With Kenosha, it’s been in very, very good shape from the moment they set foot in that area. The Sheriff’s been great. The police commissioner, the police chief has been great. We’ve been working with all of them, but the governor let us do what we had to do, and we cleaned it up. We’ll see what happens. We have to keep it going, but we won’t have any problems.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-speaks-in-orange-tx-with-ted-cruz-greg-abbott-august-29","Transcript: Donald Trump Speaks in Orange, TX with Ted Cruz & Greg Abbott August 29","28:13"

"Speaker 9","You mentioned the National Guard going in on enforcement, but this was a young man, 1- year-old, who’s facing murder charges for having shot two people. There’s some folks who’ve said conservatives are holding up this young man, have having done so within his rights, so self protect. I’m wondering if you’ve read much about this case. If you have concerns about ordinary residents with guns in situations like this and what a dangers that might present.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-speaks-in-orange-tx-with-ted-cruz-greg-abbott-august-29","Transcript: Donald Trump Speaks in Orange, TX with Ted Cruz & Greg Abbott August 29","28:46"

Right now, we’re looking at it very, very carefully what we are doing. It’s a great state, Wisconsin. Great state, and they should not have to put up with what they went through.

"Speaker 11","… briefings, but full-intel briefings. But it really comes down to one simple thing. The last time they gave briefings, a few members went out, and talked to the press and disclosed information that they shouldn’t have disclosed, so he’s going to make sure that there’s the proper tools for their oversight and make sure that they contain it in a way that does not jeopardize sources and methods for the intel that we gathered.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-speaks-in-orange-tx-with-ted-cruz-greg-abbott-august-29","Transcript: Donald Trump Speaks in Orange, TX with Ted Cruz & Greg Abbott August 29","30:03"

"Donald Trump","Director Ratcliffe brought information into the committee and the information leaked. Whether it was “Shifty” Schiff or somebody else, they leak the information before it gets in. What’s even worse, they leak the wrong information. He got tired of it, so he wants to do it in a different forum because you have leakers on the committee, obviously, leakers that are doing bad things, probably not even legal to leak.

"Speaker 12","A question about Laura. In June of this year, NOAA issued a report indicating that climate change is at least in part responsible for increasing sea temperatures, which then in turn lead to storms like Laura and Harvey. In an area where petrochemicals and the energy industry are so critical, how do you balance that with, at the same time, attacking climate change so that storms like this don’t continue to ravage the Gulf Coast?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/transcript-donald-trump-speaks-in-orange-tx-with-ted-cruz-greg-abbott-august-29","Transcript: Donald Trump Speaks in Orange, TX with Ted Cruz & Greg Abbott August 29","31:11"
