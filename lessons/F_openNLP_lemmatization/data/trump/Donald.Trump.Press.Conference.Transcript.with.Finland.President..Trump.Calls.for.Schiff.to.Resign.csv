"Donald Trump","Yes, yes. See, he’s a man of few words and he gets it done.. That’s what I like about him anyway, okay, thank you all very much.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","00:04"
"Speaker 3","President Trump, how are you responding against charges that you are putting the whistleblower’s life in danger?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","00:14"
"Donald Trump","Well, the whistleblower was very inaccurate. The whistleblower started this whole thing by writing a report on the conversation I had with the president of Ukraine. And the conversation was perfect. It couldn’t have been nicer. I saw a Rick Scott. I saw many of the Senators talking about it. Many of the congressmen talking about it. Not a thing wrong. Unless you heard the Adam Schiff version where he made up my conversation. He actually made it up.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","00:19"
"Donald Trump","It should be criminal. It should be treasonous. He made it up. Every word of it, made up and read to Congress as though I said it, and I’ll tell you what, he should be forced to resign from Congress. Adam Schiff. He’s a lowlife. He should be forced to resign. He took a perfect conversation, realized he couldn’t read it to Congress because it was perfect. It was a very nice conversation. I knew many people were on the phone. Not only were many people on the phone, we had stenographers on the phone taking it down word for word.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","00:44"
"Donald Trump","He took that conversation, which was perfect. He said, “I can’t read this.” So he made up a conversation and he reported it and said it to Congress and to the American people. And it was horrible what he said. And that was supposed to be coming from me, but it was all fabricated. He should resign from office in disgrace. And frankly they should look at him for treason because he is making up the words of the President of the United States. Not only words, but the meaning. And it’s a disgrace. It should not be allowed to happen.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","01:15"
"Speaker 3","Your own DNI said the call transcript was consistent with the complaint. So, should [crosstalk 00:01:54].","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","01:47"
"Donald Trump","No, no. He didn’t say that. You have to take a look. No, no, no. He did not say that. And in fact, if you look at what he said, he found everything to be very normal. He’s a good man. And Joe, and he found it to be very normal. I saw Schiff trying to go 15… I call him Shifty Schiff. We don’t call him Shifty Schiff for nothing. He’s a shifty, dishonest guy, who by the way was critical of one of the great Secretary of States, graduated number one in his class at West Point, graduated top of it. One of the top of his class at Harvard Law School, the most honorable person, Mike Pompeo. And this guy was negative when Mike Pompeo… There’s an expression, “he couldn’t carry his blank strap.” I won’t say it because they’ll say it was so terrible to say, but that guy couldn’t carry his blank strap. You understand that?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","01:53"
"Donald Trump","So you deal with bad people. And I watched China over the last few days and I watched some of these other countries build up, build up, build up, and we’ve built up more than any of them because of me. But no help due to the Democrats. They’re a disaster. They’re the Do Nothing Democrats. They don’t do any work. All they want to do is try and win the election in 2020. So they come up with this impeachment nonsense and everyone knows. The conversation, all based on one phone call that I had where I’m talking to the president of Ukraine. You’ll hear from our ambassadors, you’ll hear from some of the folks that know all about the call, why the call was set up and everything else. It’s perfect. The call was perfect. In fact, Lindsey Graham said, “I didn’t know you could be so nice.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","02:45"
"Donald Trump","There was no quid pro quo. Remember before they said, the only reason I put that out, and I did it with the approval of Ukraine by the way, otherwise I couldn’t have done it, was because the whistleblower was so dishonest. The whistleblower said terrible things about the call, but I then found out he was second hand and third hand. In other words, he didn’t know I was on the call. No, these are bad people. These are dishonest people.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","03:31"
"Donald Trump","And when the American people find out what happened, it’s going to be a great day and you know what? We have to go back to building our country because 99% of Nancy Pelosi’s time is spent on this. She should worry about lowering the price of drugs, which I’ve done. But it’s hard to do it without the help of Congress. About creating border security, which I’ve done. We now have hundreds of miles of wall under construction on the southern border. She should worry about infrastructure. She should worry about the USMCA. She’s not doing it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","03:55"
"Donald Trump","I just saw a part of her press conference before the president of Canada. I’m sorry to bother you with this, Mr. President because we have other things to talk about, but I will tell you I just watched part. She says, “Oh, drug prices.” Well, she’s been trying to get drug prices down for… How long has she been in Congress? For years. She should focus on her own district. Do you see what’s happening to her district? We call it tent city. It’s terrible. In fact, we just sent a violation to the city of San Francisco, unsafe water, unsafe conditions, environmental. EPA. Our EPA, which is doing a great job, is sending Nancy Pelosi with all the talk about EPA. There’s needles and drugs all over the street. There’s tents. There’s people that are dying in squalor in the best location in San Francisco.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","04:27"
"Donald Trump","It used to be a great city. Now you have to see what’s happened to San Francisco. You happen to see what the Democrats have allowed to happen, as an example, what they’ve allowed to happen. Just take a look to Los Angeles, great cities. One other thing, yesterday, as you know I was sued by the governor, Gavin Newsom. He’s another beauty. I was sued by him. He’s a do nothing. Sued by him so that I can’t get on the ballot in the State of California. It was a massive story. It was the biggest story, Mr. President, it was headlines all over the place. Trump gets sued by this do nothing governor in California. It was big.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","05:16"
"Donald Trump","Here’s what happened. Yesterday, I won the case very convincingly. A very tough, smart, highly respected judge, not a Trump person at all, not appointed by Trump, appointed by somebody that you would call the opposition, came out with a scathing and tough opinion. I won the case. I didn’t see one story that I won that case. Not one story from the fake news. I didn’t see Steve write it. I didn’t see you write it. I didn’t see anybody write it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","06:01"
"Donald Trump","So let me just tell you just to finish Nancy Pelosi and Shifty Schiff, who should resign in disgrace by the way, and Jerry Nadler and all of them. It’s a disgrace what’s going on. And we should be focused on making America great again and keeping America great because that’s what we have to do. And when I look at that parade with military and millions of people and everything else, we better get smart. We better start focusing on the right things because what they did with this nonsense, think of it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","06:34"
"Donald Trump","You have a perfect, I mean perfect conversation with a president of another country, Ukraine in this case. And they try and say, “Oh, let’s impeach them.” They’ve been trying to impeach me from the day I got elected. I’ve been going through this for three years. They’ve been trying to impeach me from the day I got elected. And you know what? They failed. And This is the easiest one of all because this one is based on one conversation. What about Obama’s conversation with the president of Russia where he says, “Hey, hey, tell Vlad I’ll talk to him after the election’s over. I’ll talk to him.” Nobody reports that. That stuff you should report.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","07:08"

Yes.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","07:52"

"Donald Trump","No Republicans have raised concerns.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","08:20"

"Donald Trump","I don’t care. Look, I think a whistleblower should be protected if the whistleblower’s legitimate. But when the whistleblower makes a big report on the conversation I had with a president of Ukraine and it was a great conversation. We talk mostly about congratulations on your win. We talked about corruption and what really referring mostly to 2016 because what the Democrats did in 2016 was corrupt. And let’s see what happens. They’re more concerned with that than they are with me and impeachment. They’re trying to hide what maybe is coming. I let our great, if you look, I’ll let our great law enforcement take care of it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","08:26"
"Donald Trump","Attorney General Barr I guess is working on it. And I hope he’s working on it because what happened in 2016 is a disgrace to this country. And they’re more worried about that because they know they’re guilty as hell. All right. They’re much more worried about that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","09:10"

"Donald Trump","When a whistleblower… Okay. Are you ready? I heard the whistleblower’s report from you people. And how bad it was about just a simple conversation. By the way, this whole thing revolves around a simple conversation. And if you remember at the beginning, it was quid pro quo. That’s all you heard about. And I think you said seven or eight times quid… In other words, “You are going to do that or we’re not going to give you money. You’re going to do this or we’re not going to…” I never said it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","09:29"
"Donald Trump","But when I heard these horrible stories come out, I had no choice but to release a conversation, which I hate to do and I hope I don’t have to do it again with the leader of a country. I asked a certain person to call up a certain person in that country to get permission to do it. Otherwise I wouldn’t have been able to do it. And if I didn’t do it, and I appreciate Ukraine for allowing us to release the conversation. But it was so innocent. It didn’t hurt them if anything had helped them because there was a very innocent conversation.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","09:59"
"Donald Trump","But when a whistleblower takes that very nice, innocent… Lindsey Graham said, “I never knew you were that nice a person.” He said, “You never asked him for anything. You were really, really nice.” Lindsey was saying, “I never knew you was so nice. That was a perfect conversation.” I heard Rick Scott today say, “That was a perfect conversation. How can they impeach him on that conversation?” He read it. He’s a very smart guy from Florida, Rick Scott, and he said, “That was a perfect conversation. How can you impeach somebody on that conversation?”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","10:29"
"Donald Trump","But the whistleblower wrote not that conversation. He wrote a vicious conversation. In other words, he either got it totally wrong, made it up, or the person giving the information to the whistleblower was dishonest. And this country has to find out who that person was because that person’s a spy, in my opinion. You ready?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","10:59"
"Donald Trump","So when a whistleblower purposely or not gives something that’s totally erroneous. Now here’s where I fooled them. They never thought I’d released the conversation. They’d never thought in a million years that I’d released the conversation. When little Adam Schiff saw the text, when he read it, he couldn’t believe it. When Nancy Pelosi, who worked a day early, Nancy Pelosi called for essentially impeachment, let’s impeach the president, before she saw the transcript. And this is an exact word for word transcript of the conversation. Taken by very talented stenographers. Listen to me. So when she saw that, I heard she went crazy.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","11:20"
"Donald Trump","She said, “We can’t impeach him of this conversation. That’s a great conversation.” She went by the whistleblower and the whistleblower was so bad. I wouldn’t even think about it. But here’s what happened. The whistleblower was wrong. The only thing that matters is the transcript of the actual conversation that I had with the president of Ukraine. It was perfect. We’re looking at congratulations. We’re looking at doing things together and what are we looking at? We’re looking at corruption.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","12:06"
"Donald Trump","And in, I believe 1999, there was a corruption act or corruption bill passed and signed between both countries where I have a duty to report corruption. And let me tell you something, biden’s son is corrupt and Biden is corrupt, and I’d rather run against Biden than almost any of those candidates. And I think they’re all week, but I think Biden has never been a smart guy and he’s less smart now than he ever was. Thank you very much.

"Donald Trump","Let me do that again. It’s a fair question. So this morning and last night, my comms people came to me, listen to this one president. I’m glad they’re interested in Finland, but what can you do. I’m interested in Finland much more. But my comms people came to me and they said, “Sir, there’s a book or something being written.” It’s written by Washington post people, so you know it’s inaccurate. You know it’s probably a fraud. So two reporters of the Washington… and they said “President Trump started screaming, ranting and raving that on the southern border, where we are right now building a tremendous wall, it’s unbelievable what’s going on. Army Corps of Engineers. We’re doing a lot. We’ll soon have over a hundred miles under construction completed and we’re going to end up with over 400 to 500 miles.

"Donald Trump","That I wanted a wall, but I wanted a moat, a moat, whatever that is. Not a word I used, but they used it. A moat. And in the moat I wanted alligators and snakes, and I wanted the wall to be a fence, and I want it to be electrified, and I wanted sharp spikes at the top, so if anyone gets it, it goes piercing through their skin is somewhat the way they said it. Skin piercing spikes. But I want that whole wall to be electrocuted. And “Sir, you never said that.” They came to me, the comms people, they came to me yesterday and they said, “Did you say this?” I said, “Why are you asking that stupid question?”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","14:04"
"Donald Trump","Because the fake news media is saying that you said this in a book. I said, “What book?” And they said, “Washington Post.” I said, “Well, obviously it’s fake because almost everything the Washington Post does is fake. It’s a fake newspaper. It’s owned by a rich guy for the purposes of giving him power in Washington. I mean it’s a lobbyist.” I call it the lobbyist Washington Post for Amazon. And he ought to be ashamed of himself because what they do to his reputation, I think maybe it’s probably no good anyway. But what they do to his reputation with the Washington post is a disgrace.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","14:47"
"Donald Trump","So these two reporters wrote this book and they said, “I want a moat with alligators, snakes electrified fences so people get electrocuted if they so much as touch the fence and spikes on top.” Never said it, never thought of it. And I actually put out something on social media today. I said “I’m tough on the border, but I’m not that tough.” Okay. It was a lie. Just so you have it. You asked a question, it was a total lie. It was corrupt reporting.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","15:19"
"Donald Trump","I don’t even use fake anymore. I call the fake news now corruptors because fake isn’t tough enough, and I’m the one that came up with the term. I’m very proud of it, but I think I’m going to switch it largely to corrupt news because the media in this country, not everybody, we have some great reporters, some great journalists, but much of it is corrupt. It’s corrupt. You have corrupt media in this country, and it truly is the enemy of the people. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.

"Donald Trump","The American and Finnish people are linked by an abiding commitment to self-government, individual rights, democracy, and the rule of law. This past May, our countries celebrated the 100th anniversary of America’s recognition of the independent nation of Finland in 1919. As President Wilson wrote at the time, “Our recognition was prompted by the sympathies for a cause similar to that which caused our own Declaration of Independence in 1776.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","01:01"
"Donald Trump","A century after we established diplomatic relations, United States and Finland remained United by those same cherished values. Central to this effort is our nation’s close cooperation on matters of security and defense. Although Finland is not a member of NATO, save a lot of money, Finland participates in many NATO missions and exercises, and I’m pleased that Finland is substantially increasing its military budget. America and Finland are also working together to advance stability, freedom of navigation, and respect for national sovereignty in the Arctic. Both of our nations are committed to a secure Arctic region, free from external intrusion, interference and coercion. Simply put, we believe that the affairs of the Arctic should be governed by the actual nations of the Arctic. And as you know, there are other people coming into the Arctic, and we don’t like it, and we can’t let it happen, and we won’t let it happen.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","01:36"

It is critical that we use safe and trustworthy technology providers, components, and supply chains. We welcome the establishment of the UROS Innovation Center in Finland, Qualcomm has done a fantastic job with that. This Innovation Center will greatly expand American and Finnish businesses and cooperation in 5G. We’re also glad that the Finnish company, Nokia, it’s a great company, a global leader in 5G technology is developing its cutting edge products right here in the United States at Bell Labs in New Jersey.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","02:39"
"Donald Trump","Across the United States, foreign direct investment from Finland totals over $10 billion. Each year, Finnish owned companies invest more than $120 million in research and development in America, and expand our exports by more than $1 billion. Just today, Finnish Nokian Tires opened a new manufacturing plant in Dayton, Tennessee, a $360 million investment that is creating hundreds of brand new beautiful jobs for a great state, Tennessee. We love Tennessee, so they made a wise choice. You never lose when you go to Tennessee.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","03:23"
"Donald Trump","I encourage other Finnish companies to increase their investments in the United States. There has simply never been a better time to do business in America. We have passed the largest tax cuts and reform, and also regulation cuts in the history of our country. We slashed business tax, and we’re fueling job growth through our record setting campaign to abolish all of those really terrible unnecessary regulations. We have plenty of regulations, but many of them we didn’t need. We got rid of them. The American economy is booming, wages are rising, incomes are soaring, and unemployment has hit its lowest level and more than half a century. We want Finnish companies to join in America’s extraordinary economic revival. So many countries are coming in, it’s the hot place. We have the hottest economy in the world, and it’s the hot place to be. They all want to be here.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","04:06"

I hope that Finland, which now holds the rotating presidency of the EU Council, will support our efforts to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement with the European Union. We are going to have to start doing something with the European Union because they have not been treating this country right for many, many years, and they know it, and I tell them, and they know it. America’s trade deficit with the EU has been averaging $160 billion a year for many, many years. Achieving more balanced and robust trade flows would greatly benefit both Finland and the United States.

Ladies and gentlemen, before meeting, I had some spare time, so I visited a couple of museums here, Museum of American History, Museum of American African History, and Museum of American Indian History.

"Pres. Niinistö","We had a very good discussion with the President. Like you mentioned, our diplomatic relations are 100 years old. During that time, we have developed our cooperation a lot, not only in official meetings like this, but American and Finnish people, scientists for example, meet each other, cooperating, working together. We have quite a lot of cooperation in the security sector, also in defense because I think that we share the feeling that the most important thing for the nation is to guarantee security to its citizens, and that is the starting point for Finland also to this cooperation.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","07:49"

We know the price of everything. We should recognize also the value of everything. We share the same values, democracy, human rights, rule-based order, and in that we are very similar. Europe has, in a way, awaken during the couple of last years to understand also more about security point of view.

We both, alongside with the six countries, form the Arctic Council, and we are working heavily. There are surely possibilities like we have heard the maritime routes are being open, to maybe there are also resources, but there are huge risks. One of them is that we should keep the low tension we are used to have there, and that is what we have been discussing.

"Pres. Niinistö","But an even greater challenge is the environment, and I’m very glad that we started to talk two years ago in this very house about black coal. It is not maybe the worst which causes climate problems, but it is, everybody can understand that if black comes down to ice and to snow, when the sun meets it, it melts down. And melting of sea ice in Arctic is very crucial.

We can’t let the situation return, no agreement at all about arms control, and that is why it is important to try to negotiate new agreements and to continue the New START Agreement.

When I arrived in Helsinki about a year and a half ago, there were a stack of papers on the desk, one of a couple of which concerned indigenous peoples from the Southwestern United States, Arizona, Colorado, including probably most predominantly, but generically, I will refer to them as Hopi Indians. They were one of the group in 1895, a lot of their remains had been excavated and removed along with about 500 artifacts to Finland. And there they’ve remained, despite a lot of activity to get them back. I’ll just jump to the end, and say through the good offices of our State Department, but in particular President Niinistö and to his entire team, we’ve secured and mutual agreement whereby all of those remains, including a number of petrified bodies, will be going back to be put back where they were buried.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","14:25"

"Pres. Niinistö","Thank you. Like I told already in Europe, their situation is maybe a bit different from that here, because the main company you mentioned is inside Europe, partly at least.

"Donald Trump","I thought that I would finish off the first term without the threat of people making false claims.

I say, how come it’s always the United States that gets ripped? Frankly, Ukraine, we want to help them, and I do like the new president. You know why I like him? Because he was honest.

Because he called up, “Please, let the money go.” I said, “Rob, I hate being the country that’s always giving money, when Ukraine helps Europe, and the European countries far more than they help us.” They’re like a wall between Russia and Europe. They’re like a wall, they’re a big, wide, beautiful wall. And he said, “You know what, but it’s important.” And in fact, he came out and he said that, that was my only reason. Because I don’t like being the sucker country. We were the sucker country for years and years. We’re not the sucker country anymore.

"Donald Trump","I’ve answered everything. It’s a whole hoax, and you know who’s playing into the hoax, people like you, and the fake news media that we have in this country. And I say in many cases the corrupt media, because you’re corrupt. Much of the media in this country is not just fake, it’s corrupt. And you have some very fine people, too. Great journalists, great reporters, but to a large extent, it’s corrupt, and it’s fake. Ask the president of Finland a question please.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","37:03"
"Jeff Mason","Okay, I’ll move on now. Mr. President, in your opening remarks, you said to President Trump that you had been to some museums today, and that you respected the US democracy and encouraged him to continue it. Are you concerned that that’s not happening? And my second question to you, sir, is the WTO rule today in favor of the United States saying that the United States can now impose tariffs on European goods because of illegal subsidies against Airbus.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","37:31"
"Donald Trump","That was a big win for the United States, right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","37:58"

"Donald Trump","You never had wins with other presidents, did you?

"Jeff Mason","This was a case that started I think 10 or 15 years ago.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","38:07"
"Donald Trump","Excuse me. Get Windsor now, because they think I don’t like the WTO, and they want to make sure I’m happy, because all of those countries were ripping off the United States for many years. They know that I’m wise to it. We’ve had a lot of wins. This was a $7 billion win, not bad.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","38:10"
"Pres. Niinistö","But I think the question is for me.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","38:26"
"Jeff Mason","So the question sir is if you’re concerned that the president will impose those tariffs, and the effect that that may have on the economy.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","38:28"
"Pres. Niinistö","Yes. First of all, may I refer to your democracy. I just wanted to tell that I’m impressed what American people have gained during these decades, hundreds of years. Peeling up very impressive democracy. So keep it going on. To WTO, I have a lot of respect to multi-lateralism, and to international institutions, so WTO has given now a decision which is well, quite tough with Europe, but I just say that the WTO has said its opinion, and that’s that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","38:35"
"Donald Trump","I just want to finish by saying it’s an honor to be with the President of Finland. He’s done a fantastic job, very popular, beloved, over in Finland. The WTO has been much better to us since I’ve been president, because they understand they can’t get away with what they’ve been getting away with for so many years, which is ripping off the United States. And please remember the president’s last remarks, that we are a great democracy. We are a great, the United States is a great democracy, and I’m airing what I’m airing, because we are in fact a democracy. And if the press were straight, and honest, and forthright, and tough, we would be a far greater nation.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","39:32"

"Donald Trump","We would be a far greater, when we don’t have the CNNs of the world who are corrupt people.

"Jeff Mason","Mr. President, [inaudible 00:40:30].","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","40:26"
"Reena Ninan","All right. We’re listening into a joint press conference with the President of Finland and President Trump there. I want to bring in CBSN political reporter, Caitlin Huey-Burns, and CBS news contributor and Republican strategist, Leslie Sanchez. Caitlin, I want to start with you. I mean the focus, obviously, the president very agitated. Looking, taking questions on about this impeachment inquiry and subpoenas. I want to get your take on exactly what the president had to say, Caitlin.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","40:38"
"Caitlin","Right, and this comes after a lengthy, kind of impromptu press conference that he had with the President of Finland earlier in the oval office at what was supposed to be a photo op. So this is an extension of this, and proof that the president is really wanting to continue to talk about the investigation. He came prepared with a printout of the New York Times reporting that had just come out, that said that Adam Schiff had received information that the whistleblower was wanting to put forward in a report, and so he was earlier today criticizing the New York Times today praising for that report.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","41:03"
"Caitlin","But he also said a few different things of note. He said Mike Pompeo was on the line for that call. We know the Secretary of State said that today. But again, confirming the reporting, he continued to berate Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who has become a punching bag for the president, likes to bring him up a lot, has even given him a nickname as well. He called this-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","41:45"
"Reena Ninan","And Caitlin, I just want to mention, you know, the president has said that Schiff was given, helped the whistleblower write his complaint, which is an allegation that, in fact I want you to hear it directly from the president. Here’s what he had to say about that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","42:12"
"Donald Trump","Well, I think it’s a scandal that he knew before, I’d go a step further. I think he probably helped write it. Okay? That’s what the word is. And I think it’s a, I give a lot of respect for the New York Times for putting it out. Just happened as I’m walking up here, they handed it to me, and I said to Mike, I said, “Whoa, that’s something. That’s big stuff.” That’s a big story. He knew long before, and he helped write it too. It’s a scam. It’s a scam.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","42:27"
"Reena Ninan","Well, the House Intelligence Committee has a very different take on all this, and they released a statement. I want to read it to you, and it says like other whistleblowers have done, before, and since under Republican and Democratic controlled committees, the whistleblower contacted the committee for guidance on how to report possible wrongdoing within the jurisdiction of the intelligence community. This is a regular occurrence, given the committee’s unique oversight role and responsibilities. At no point did the committee review or receive the complaint in advance. I think we have Paula Reed at the White House. Paula, I want you to weigh in to get your sense as to what we’ve heard so far.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","42:55"
"Paula Reid","Well the president was critically pleased with his New York Times story. As you noted, he walked out with a physical copy. Now we have to look at how Adam Schiff handled the hearing last week with acting DNI director Maguire. He opened that hearing in a very unusual way. He laid out his sort of mobster narrative of what had happened, and then he did sort of ad lib what happened in this conversation. It was very strange, Reena. Instead of just reading quotes from what had happened, and the president has seized on this. He has mentioned this repeatedly today, suggesting that Adam Schiff had apparently committed treason by putting words into the mouth of the president. So at every opportunity, when the president is asked about his conversation with the Ukraine, when he’s asked about withholding military aid, he just quickly pivots to Adam Schiff, and this New York Times story gives him more fodder. Because here he suggests this was a conspiracy against him, that Adam Schiff knew about this and helped push these accusations.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","43:29"
"Reena Ninan","I want to get Leslie Sanchez to weigh in. Leslie, you know this nickname Shifty Schiff, he made a point of saying that, and the spokesman for Schiff came up very quickly. They knew that they had to put out this statement, but what do you make of what we’ve heard from them today?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","44:28"
"Leslie Sanchez","I think it’s consistent with the way the president pushes back. I’ll tell you one thing, people appreciate that about the president. People that voted for him want to see that he’s going to punch back, and those are direct terms, we like that he does that. I think it was very consistent with him for him to say it was a hoax. This is a scam. He is using a parody of me, and defining that, because if you’re somebody who’s apolitical, you’re kind of generally following what’s happening, and you listen to this, that it’s so hyper-partisan that a decision was made before they ever heard the testimony, before we even saw the transcript of the call ,that the Democrats already had sealed the fate of the president in their minds. This is laying into that argument, and I think in that way the president made his points.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","44:40"
"Reena Ninan","Caitlin, I want to get you to weigh in. In this statement from Patrick Boland, which is the spokesman for chairman Adam Schiff of the House Intelligence Committee. He made a point to say that at no point did the committee review, or receive the complaint in advance. The office of the director of national intelligence, at the behest of the White House refused to disclose the subject matter, or the substance of the complaint to the committee, and they went on to say the committee didn’t receive the complaint until the night before the acting director of the National Intelligence opened the hearing. But that is not what the president said today.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","45:23"
"Caitlin","Right, and the reporting in the New York Times said that the whistleblower had expressed some concern about how the process was going, and therefore went to the committee. But that is not stopping the president, and Republicans who are also seizing on this, those who are supportive of the president seizing on this to make a case that this is a political situation here. And that’s what we’ve seen from Republicans throughout this entire affair, which is that they are by and large supportive of the president, and focused a lot on the process of how this all happened, instead of the underlying issues and questions. And you even heard the president there. I would note that he kept referencing the transcript, which he said was word for word, which is not what it was at the top of that-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","45:54"
"Reena Ninan","There was a big statement at the bottom of that, yes, absolutely.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","46:50"
"Caitlin","Sorry. At the bottom of that, right, exactly. Said that this was a summary of what happened, so it was not word for word. But I think it’s important to note that Republicans have stood by the president, and that is reflected in our polling on impeachment, on the impeachment inquiry, which shows that Republicans are still supportive of the president.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","46:52"
"Reena Ninan","That’s a good point. President Trump said that he’d cooperate with the subpoenas. I want to play for you what he said just a short time ago.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","47:13"

"Donald Trump","Well, I always cooperate. This is a hoax. This is the greatest hoax, this is just a continuation of what’s been playing out, John, for the last, since my election, I would say, if you wanted. Probably, we’ll find out soon, but probably even before my election. This is a fraudulent crime, when the American people…","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","47:21"
"Reena Ninan","Paula, we know that the President and the White House has stonewalled Congress on these efforts, the testimony and the documents, do we expect this to be any different?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","47:41"
"Paula Reid","Absolutely not Reena. I’ve spoken to several of the president’s attorneys, both here at the White House and his outside counsel, and they really don’t see this impeachment inquiry that was announced last week as being anything significant. There argument is look, until Polosi holds a floor vote on impeachment, they are not under any more obligation to cooperate. So far, their MO in terms of congressional oversight has been to cooperate to the minimum required under law. They will negotiate, sometimes they’ll even litigate, but in terms of documents and witnesses, they try to give as little as they need to. Now, if there is a floor vote about a formal impeachment inquiry, that will dilute some of the president’s protections here. That makes it a little bit harder to hide behind executive privilege. I’m told that would be a game changer. But for the president to say that they always cooperate, well that is false.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","47:49"
"Reena Ninan","So Paula, let’s say the president chooses not to cooperate at this point. I mean, is there a sense of what we’re seeing, the deadline is Friday, right? What are you looking and watching for in the coming days this week?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","48:38"
"Paula Reid","I’m not sure specifically, there’s so many subpoenas. I mean, he’s not wrong that Nancy Polosi really does hand these out like cookies. That is fact check true. And the White House has just been blanketed in all of these various requests. They’ve tried to fend off many of them. In some cases they’ll negotiate, but going forward, I don’t think they’re going to change the way they process this. In some instances, if they think a court would compel them to share something, they will offer a compromise. Lawmakers can come to the White House, see thing…","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-with-finland-president-trump-calls-for-schiff-to-resign","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript with Finland President: Trump Calls for Schiff to Resign","48:48"
