It’s like Kosovo and Serbia. You look at what’s happened there. We’re doing a trade deal, BB, two trade deals. They were killing each other all the time for 25 years. Right? Much longer than that.

There was a ship, a huge ship, container ship, that came in from the Emirates. Okay? Second container ship. The first one was a week earlier. So these were the first container ships coming from the free trade area in Dubai, coming to Isso. They had consumer goods there. They had actually washing machines.

Could you see that?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","14:26"

"Jeff Mason","Can we ask Prime Minister Netanyahu how he feels about that?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","14:30"
"President Trump","I would say that. Yeah, sure. Go ahead.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","14:32"
"Jeff Mason","Prime Minister Netanyahu, if you can hear me, Jeff Mason [crosstalk 00:14:38].","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","14:35"
"President Trump","This is Jeff Mason. He’s got a mask on. It’s the largest mask I think I’ve ever seen. I don’t know if you can hear him, but he wants to know about what you think, what you gentlemen think about, as I said, when it’s all finished up and everybody’s in the deal, I said that I wouldn’t be surprised to see Iran be very friendly, also. You have everybody unified and I think that Iran will be in some way involved. And what do you think about that?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","14:38"
"Benjamin Netanyahu ","Well, I was beginning to say that when I spoke in the American Congress, I didn’t say I was opposed to any deal. I said I was opposed to that deal because that deal listed all sorts of restrictions from Iran and did not condition any change, require any change of behavior from Iran. Iran essentially increased its aggression after the deal, rather than reduce it. Ballistic missiles, enrichment of uranium for atomic bombs with all sorts of tourism in the region. I think that if a new deal is offered… And that’s what I actually said when I spoke to the U.S. Congress, a different deal is offered, it would be welcome.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","15:06"
"Benjamin Netanyahu ","I think that will only happen if Iran faces, I would say, faces strong opposition to its aggression, the kind that had been floated by you, Mr. President. I think if you’re soft on Iran, you’re not going to get peace with Iran. If you’re strong against Iran and prevent it, as you had just said, from achieving nuclear weapons, then I think that they might come around to a better deal. A better deal, a real deal, I think is something that no one will be opposed to. But so far, that’s not been available.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","15:47"
"President Trump","When everybody’s unified, and this is all done, and it won’t be in a long period of time, Iran will be in some way involved. If not part of the deal, they’ll be very happy. And you know what? They’re tired of fighting too. They’re tired of what’s going on. Those are great people and they want an end to it. They want an end to it. In fact, if we win the election, they don’t want me to say when, but I always say if, because it’s an election, right? If we win the election, one of the first calls I’ll get will be from Iran. Let’s make a deal. One of the first calls I’ll get. They don’t want me to win and Russia doesn’t want me to win either.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","16:20"
"President Trump","You know what was unique about those two countries? They both don’t want me to win and that’s okay. But I think we’re going to win. And I think if you start looking at what’s happening in these states, and the votes that are coming in, and the amount of votes that are coming in, and the great red wave hasn’t hit yet, that hits in a few days. It’s going to be a great red wave like you’ve never seen before. You’re going to have a wave like you’ve never seen before. It’s going to be all red and it’s going to be a thing of beauty. Have a good time, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much everybody and I’ll see you all soon, okay? Thank you very much.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","17:00"
"President Trump","We have some very talented people from the press here and I’ll just make a quick statement. On the phone we have some terrific people, Chairman Abdel al-Burhan and Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok of Sudan, a beautiful part of the world and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, I think you mostly know him. You perhaps heard of him somewhere. We have the very highly sophisticated press. I think they may have heard of him, of Israel. I want to just congratulate all of you. The state of Israel and the Republic of Sudan have agreed to make peace. This is for many, many years, they’ve been at odds, to put it nicely, and to normalize their relations. This will be the third country where we’re doing this and we have many, many more coming. They’re coming at us hot and heavy in the coming weeks, they will meet to negotiate cooperation agreements. You saw that happened with UAE and Bahrain recently, in agriculture, technology, aviation, migration, and other critical areas. This historic deal comes just a few weeks after the groundbreaking agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Israel and Bahrain.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","18:00"
"President Trump","That was very historic. That was a great day, a very historic day. Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, three months ago, no one thought this would be possible. Even BB didn’t know that this was going to be possible, BB, right? But now multiple Arab countries across two continents have made peace with Israel. And again, we have many lined up. They want to come in. They want to get the deal done. They all see it, no blood in the sand. I say no blood. This is one where there’s been no blood in the sand. It was common sense. It should have been done this way a long time ago. It’s a very special deal for much of recent history. The people of Sudan were ruled over by brutal Islamic dictatorships. It was the home of Osama bin Laden, a place of terror, genocide, and many of the tragedies today. A great people of Sudan are in charge and new democracy is taking root.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","19:16"
"President Trump","And the two people I have just mentioned are highly-respected leaders, highly, highly-respected leaders. The Sudanese transitional government has demonstrated its commitment to combating terrorism, creating market economy, and developing the democratic institution that is becoming today’s deal, builds on those commitments, and marks a pivotal turning point in Sudan’s history. This is, I would say, one of the great days in the history of Sudan. This is an incredible deal for Israel and Sudan. For decades, Sudan has been at a state of war with Israel. They have been in a state of war and boycotted Israeli goods, there was no relationship whatsoever. Today’s peace agreement will enhance Israel’s security and end Sudan’s long isolation from the world because of what was taking place. It will unlock new opportunities for trade and commerce, education and research, and cooperation and friendship for both peoples. I want to thank the leaders of Sudan. I want to thank you very much for being with us. And of course, Benjamin, for the incredible work you do constantly. We’ve had a tremendous relationship.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","20:11"
"President Trump","There’s never been a relationship where Israel and the United States were so close. And I would say a few years ago, there’s probably never been a time when it was so far apart, so distant, if you want to know the truth. But this is a tremendous show of faith and courage and leadership, which has forged this agreement. The United States stands with all of you and all the nations that seek peace and cooperation. And again, we will be signing many nations over the next coming weeks and months, including some very big ones. It’s very exciting, actually. It’s peace in the Middle East without bloodshed. And it should have been done this way a long time ago. The Palestinians, by the way, if you ask about the Palestinians, they’re wanting to do something. They’ve never seen anything like this. They’re wanting to do something. I’m sure that will get done too. I’d like to congratulate everybody on the phone. And I don’t know if you have interpreters or if you needed the interpreters for that. But if you do, you can go forward, interpreters, if you need them.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","21:21"
"Prime Minister, Sudan","Mr. President, I am very pleased to speak to you President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu. This call is indeed, an indication that a new chapter in our history is done. And the rest of the world has just begun. I would like to start with expressing my thanks to you, President Trump for taking the decision for protecting the [inaudible 00:22:57] of Sudan has [inaudible 00:23:01]. This decision, the decision of the [inaudible 00:22:59] of Sudan, [inaudible 00:23:04] economic situation in Sudan. [inaudible 00:23:10] in common. More importantly, it helps Sudan [inaudible 00:23:17] as a [inaudible 00:23:20], peace-loving [inaudible 00:00:23:20], as a nation, you have never [inaudible 00:11:26].

Thank you so much.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","22:21"
"President Trump","Well, thank you very much. It was beautifully stated and I appreciate it.

"Benjamin Netanyahu ","Well, I want to say that we are expanding the circle of peace so rapidly with your leadership, Mr. President, your [inaudible 00:24:07] team. History in the making. Actually, we’re all making history. From the Emirates to Bahrain now with Sudan and other countries that are in line, I think that this truly changes the region. It changes the lives of all our peoples for the better. It allows us to focus on the task of building nations, building our future, building technology, agriculture, environment, health, everything. And I think we can do it better together. And with your help, the help of the United States, the possibilities are infinite.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","24:03"
"Benjamin Netanyahu ","We used to say in the Middle East, the sky’s the limit. But now we don’t even have that because the skies are limitless. We fly over the Sudan. We fly over Saudi Arabia. We fly to Bahrain. We fly to the Emirates. Everybody flies to us. It’s just a new world. And I can’t tell you how excited we are for cooperating with everyone, the cooperating with Sudan to build the future, a better future for both of us. And it’s a glorious day for peace. I want to thank you again, Mr. President, for everything you’re doing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","24:46"
"President Trump","Even the media is very excited about it. I mean, everybody is excited about it. It’s an incredible thing. And again, as you know, Bibi, because you’re negotiating and talking to people, but they’re falling into line. Everybody’s going to be involved in this very shortly, I would say. Who knows? I can’t exactly put a date on, but within a very few number of months, everybody’s going to be in this deal. And that’s the way it should have been done a long time ago. We did it the opposite way, exactly the opposite way and we took a lot of abuse from the people that were unable to make a deal for 40 years.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","25:19"
"President Trump","And this has gone very quickly, very nicely, very inexpensively and with no blood. So we’re very happy about that. Would anybody else like to say something and then I’ll have the press ask. Perhaps they may have a question for you. Please, go ahead, Prime Minister.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","25:54"

"Mike Pompeo","Just this Mr. President, this is a big day. I want to thank Prime Minister, Netanyahu, Prime Minister Hamdok, Chairman Buran for their hard work over the past months to get to a place which will increase peace and prosperity throughout, not only the middle East, but in North Africa. And that’s a good thing for the whole world today, Mr. President","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","26:52"

"Jared Kushner","Thank you, Mr. President. Well, I think that today is another great example of what is possible when you have strong and smart American leadership in the Middle East and throughout the world. For those who follow the history of this conflict, the significance of this cannot be overstated enough. You have a situation in 1967 after the six day war, the Arab league met in Sudan, and in [inaudible 00:03:37]. they had the declaration of what was became known as the three no’s for the Arab League. No peace, no recognition, no negotiations. Now today we have peace. We have the three yes’s under president Trump. We have peace, we have recognition and we have negotiation for even more peace. So this is a tremendous acceleration of the turning point that President Trump has been able to accomplish in the region. And I do really believe that we’re seeing this pickup even more and more.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","27:14"
"Jared Kushner","We have more countries that are going to be making peace with Israel. We’re very confident that the Israeli Palestinian conflict will be resolved as well. And I do think that will allow us to focus on reducing extremism and terrorism, and then also reducing antisemitism throughout the world. And both of those cannot be understated enough as big accomplishments. And I will just say finally, that if you look at where Sudan was in 2016, versus where they are now, again, you have a President who’s not lecturing other countries. But for countries who want to improve their lot and make progress, there’s no better partner than America. And that’s what you’re seeing with Sudan and with the Middle East. And I will just say as well that these peace agreements are not as easy as President Trump and his team are making them look. These are very hard agreements. These are conflicts that have gone on for decades in many regards and getting people to resolve these conflicts and focus on how you can create a brighter future is just a tremendous thing that makes America safer and the world a better place. So thank you, Mr. President for your leadership.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","28:06"
"President Trump","It’s very funny when Jared said that, it’s true. They’ve been going on for, you could say centuries in some cases really. I mean, if you think about it, but they’ve been going on for many decades and it’s just falling into place. It’s all falling into. It’s the right system and all falling in.

"Steve","And I think it’s shown a tremendous amount of courage for you to put your political capital and to put your leadership at risk. I think it’s also shows a tremendous amount of courage. With the leaders who are on the phone, with the Prime Minister of Israel, the Prime Minister of Sudan, the chairman, the council of Sudan, King Hamad, Crown Prince [inaudible 00:06:09]. It’s taken a tremendous amount of courage, but it’s not just here, Mr. President. At your direction, Secretary Pompeo signed a peace agreement with the Taliban.

"Steve","And you brought normalization to Serbia and Kosovo. Economic normalization. Kosovo is another Muslim majority nation that has recognized Israel and moved their capital to Jerusalem or move their embassy in Jerusalem. So again, Mr. President, I think you and the team that you’ve put together has just done a tremendous job, bringing peace to the America and peace to the world, which in turn brings peace to the American people and allows us to keep our sons and daughters who serve in uniform here at home and not out in the Middle East and other places as you’ve talked about during your time in office.

I was in Abu Dhabi, Mr. President representing you at the first ever Abraham Accords Business Summit between Israel and UAE and seeing the leaders of both those countries and the business people now interacting together and doing business was extraordinary.

"Brian Hook","Mr. President, the Arab Israeli conflict is moving toward its end. And this is transformative diplomacy that has been led by the president. It started with two peace agreements in the Middle East, and now it has spread to Africa. And the president has stood with Israel and countered Iran. And that has given space to our Arab partners to move closer to Israel. And so with three peace agreements, this is now the third defeat for Iran’s foreign policy. And it is another victory for America.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","31:55"

BiBi and others were very much against it at the time, but that’s what the problem was. And it was not well done, not well executed. And that agreement is practically over. Had we let that agreement stay, it’s practically over. And that would have been a pathway to nuclear weapons. And we’ll never let Iran have nuclear weapons.

When I met the chairman [inaudible 00:33:35] in Uganda, in Africa, eight months ago, I had hoped we could reach this day. But it took your diplomacy, your team, and frankly, the courage. The courage of the leaders of Sudan and their wisdom, their willingness to join all of us and this historic a historic odyssey. I mean, but this isn’t an odyssey and honestly is a long journey. This like an express train that is moving from one industry to the other. And I think one reinforces the other. And I’m very excited by a new future for Israel in Sudan. But I’m very excited also for a new future for Israel and other countries, which you and I know, Mr. President are waiting to join us.

Very soon we’d like to fly to Sudan. We’d like to have joint entrepreneurs, joint ventures, tourism, everything, I think what was changing, Mr. President, under this vision of peace is that it doesn’t have to be a zero sum game. It can be a win, win, win, win. I was going to say a win-win, but there are so many wins here that we should continue. And that’s really, I think the remarkable change that you have brought forward in this area. I’ve been frankly believing it, but it would not happen with, for a long time, but it would not happen with such an active, I would say positive and confident American position that just threw away the board and said we’re starting anew.

"President Trump","While you are on the phone, could I ask you, how is the dam doing in Ethiopia? The largest dam in many, many years, being built. Unfortunately, it stops water from flowing into the Nile, which causes Egypt a little bit of a problem, right? As it should. But Ethiopia built a dam, you know all about it probably, BB, but I’ve been dealing with Sudan on that. And I’m just curious, how is that going? Because you’re really the third party involved with Ethiopia and Egypt and the dam. Are they working out their deal? Because I had a deal done for them. And then unfortunately, Ethiopia broke the deal, which they should not have done. That was a big mistake. And we’ve stopped payment to them, of a lot of aid, because they did it. And they will never see that money, unless they adhere to the agreement. But they built a dam, which stops water from flowing into the Nile, and you can’t blame Egypt for being a little bit upset, right? How are they doing with that? Do you know?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","36:21"

"President Trump","Yeah, no. I was actually talking to Sudan, BB. Talking to the chairman, talking to the prime minister. How are you doing?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","37:20"

"Prime Minister, Sudan","[crosstalk 00:37:40] We do very much appreciate the vehicle that [inaudible 00:37:45] the Washington [inaudible 00:37:47] which in very few months brought us together. I think that the [inaudible 00:37:49] very well on this. We hope to reach a workable situation that will bring a lot of benefits of the mobility of a free nation, and while we are moving in that direction, we hope to reach an amicable solution soon for this.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","37:40"
"President Trump","Yeah. If you would, because I had a deal done and then they broke the deal and they can’t do that. They can’t do that. So the deal was done and it’s a very dangerous situation because Egypt is not going to be able to live that way and they’ll end up blowing up the dam. And I said it, and I say it loud and clear, they’ll blow up that dam and they have to do something. So whatever you can do to get them, Ethiopia to do that, they’re going to have to, okay? And we’ve cut off all payment and everything else, to Ethiopia. It was terrible. We were all set to sign a deal. It was negotiated for five years and longer than that. And they couldn’t make the deal and I got the deal done and then they’re getting ready to sign the deal and they broke the deal, which is not good. So whatever you could do, prime minister, if you could, that would be great okay? You tell them they got to get it done.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","38:09"
"President Trump","And I’m telling Egypt the same thing, by the way, because they could have stopped it. They should have stopped it long before it was started. I said, “How do you let it get built?” And then you say they have a dam. But they had other things on their mind. That was at a time when they were having a minor revolution to put it mildly. That was a bad time for Egypt. So I guess they had other things on their mind. So you’ll work on that Sudan, and thank you very much. Do you have any questions for Sudan or for Benjamin? Yes, please. Only for that please.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","39:03"
"Speaker 5","Well, more broadly than for you sir, than the gentlemen on the phone. You referenced some other countries. Can you give us a sense of which countries those are? And you also said that the Palestinians want to do something. Can you give us an update on the status of those?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","39:35"
"President Trump","Nope. I mean, they’re both just statements that we have many countries wanting to come in and we’re doing them one by one. We did Sudan. They wanted to do a deal. And that was in particular nice, because they’ve essentially been at war with Israel for a long time. I don’t know if it was fighting. I don’t know that, but probably there’s been a little bit, but certainly it’s been for many years, you’ve been officially at war with Sudan and now it’s not only the deal was signed, but it’s peace. So that’s official and that’s nice. Yeah, we have at least five that want to come in and we’ll have many more than that very soon.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","39:49"

"President Trump","Want to come in to the deal. In other words, yeah, part of the peace deal. And you know what it’s costing the United States? Nothing, nothing. It’s so nice. Isn’t that nice? I say nothing. Why should we be paying? We’re settling peace. It’s like Kosovo and Serbia. You look at what’s happened there. We’re doing a trade deal, BB, two trade deals. And they were killing each other all the time for 25 years, right? Much longer than that. I said, “Wait a minute, we’re doing trade with each country. Why don’t we just settle it up, so you don’t have to kill each other?” And they were so happy. They were so happy. So we settled the deal. We do a lot of things that people don’t know about fellas. Any other questions, for the prime minister?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","40:25"

What now [crosstalk 00:41:13]","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","41:07"
"President Trump","BB, do you want to give that? What normalized relationship, what it really means and what it means to you. Go ahead BB.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","41:12"
"Benjamin Netanyahu ","Yeah, well I’ll give you an example. It’s really mind boggling, okay? A few days ago I went into a port in Haifa. There was a ship, a huge ship, container ship that came in from the Emirates, okay? Second container ship. The first one was a week earlier. So these were the first container ships coming from the free trade area in Dubai, coming to Israel. They had consumer goods there. They had actually washing machines. Okay. That’s bringing down the price, the cost of living for the citizens of Israel right away. So first, it’s trade, okay? Then Israelis could never fly east. I mean, we had to go around the Red Sea, really around the Arabian peninsula. It would take us hours to get anywhere, let alone to get into the Arabian peninsula because we didn’t have any relations there.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","41:17"
"Benjamin Netanyahu ","Now people are planning. There are now tourism offices from Israel, all these tourism agents, flocking to Abu Dhabi and Dubai and Bahrain. And they’re now just loaded with requests from Israelis and believe it or not, the other way around. Bahrainis and Emiratis who want to come to Israel. So you have tourism, you have trade, tourism, technology, entrepreneurs, everything. I mean the same thing is going to happen with Sudan. Each of us has what it has to offer the other. It changes the lives of people.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","42:13"
"Benjamin Netanyahu ","And exactly, as you said, Mr President, we’re not engaging in bloodshed. We’re not engaging in antagonism. We’re engaging in cooperation for the present and the future. And it’s not a distant vision. It’s not a distant dream. I mean, we’re actually seeing the fruits of peace right now, in these days, days after signing these agreements. We’ve never seen anything like this. And I want to say, one thing that I do see, an enthusiasm from most countries in the world, for most people in the world, across the political divide. Yeah, Iran is unhappy. Hezbollah is unhappy. Hamas is unhappy. But most everybody else, is very happy and they should be because peace is a good thing. It’s a very good thing. So if you ask me, what does it feel like? It’s amazing and it’s fast.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","42:48"
"President Trump","They’re also poor. Iran is poor. Hamas is poor. They’re all poor. And they weren’t poor three years ago, they were blowing everything up. They’re very poor. Do you think sleepy Joe could have made this deal, BB? Sleepy Joe, do you think he would’ve made this deal? Somehow, I don’t think so.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","43:39"
"Benjamin Netanyahu ","Well, Mr President, one thing I can tell you, is we appreciate the help for peace from any one in America and we appreciate what you’ve done enormously.

Say.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","44:26"
"Speaker 5","Yeah, I just wondered if you could expand a little bit about what this means to Iran, the pressure that these deals are now placing on [crosstalk 00:44:40]","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","44:33"
"President Trump","Well, I think ultimately Iran maybe will become a member of this whole thing, if you want to really know the truth. Look in the end, you’re going to have everybody together with the United States and beyond the United States, you’ll have other major powers involved. And with it, not have to be signed into it, because it’s a region, but they’re with it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","44:39"
"President Trump","And I could see Iran… Look, someday, I’d love to help Iran. I’d love to get Iran back on track. Their GDP went down 27%. They’ve gone from a rich country to a poor country in a period of three years, and I’d love to get them back on track. They just can’t have nuclear weapons, that’s all. And nuclear weapons and it’s always death to Israel. That’s all they shout, is death to Israel, so they can’t have nuclear weapons, but they can have what they want. I mean, they should be a great nation. They’re great people. I know so many Iranians. I have a lot of Iranian friends. It should be a great nation and we want it to be a great nation, but we can’t have nuclear weapons and I could see Iran ultimately… Right now, it doesn’t sound like something that would happen, but I see it happening. Ultimately they’ll all be one unified family. It will be an amazing thing. Probably has never happened in the Middle East because the Middle East is known for conflict and fighting.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","44:57"

"President Trump","No, but I think that’s moving along, that process is moving along. It’s a good process. We’ve had an incredible relationship long-term. We’ve never had a dispute with UAE. They’ve always been on our side and that process is moving along, I think hopefully rapidly.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-announcement-transcript-israel-and-sudan-agree-to-normalize-relations","Donald Trump Announcement Transcript: Israel and Sudan Agree to Normalize Relations","46:01"
