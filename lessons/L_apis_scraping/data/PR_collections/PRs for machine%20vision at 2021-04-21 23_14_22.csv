SINGAPORE, April 1, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- According to global tech market advisory firm, ABI Research, the global installed base of smart cameras with an Artificial Intelligence (AI) chipset will reach over 350 million in 2025. The inclusion of AI chipsets in security cameras in smart cities will become a norm, with over 65% of camera shipped in 2025 expected to come with at least one AI chipset. These cameras will feature deep learning (DL) models to automate and augment decision making in applications such as intelligent traffic management, autonomous asset, pedestrian flow monitoring and management, physical and perimeter security, and preventive threat detection.""More and more city and county governments around the world are actively looking to utilize AI. This has led to a boom in the adoption of smart cameras with edge AI chipsets,"" says Lian Jye Su, Principal Analyst of AI & Machine Learning at ABI Research. Aside from low latency, data privacy concerns have also driven the adoption of AI at the edge as information can be processed without being sent to the cloud. Ambarella, HiSilicon, Intel, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and Xilinx are some of the key AI chipset suppliers in the smart city space. Increasingly, TinyML vendors that offer always-on machine vision are expected to play a key role in enabling always-on machine vision through battery-operated cameras, Lidar, infrared and other sensors.At the moment, most of these workloads are performed by either DL models hosted in the cloud, offered by video analytics vendors such as SenseTime, Ipsotek, icentana, and Sentry AI, or DL inference in smart cameras and network video recorders, such as HikVision and Dahua. Both deployment methods come with their own respective strengths and weaknesses. Two technology trends will likely further catalyze the deployment of DL-based machine vision. ""The first one is edge computing. Instead of deploying specific DL models on smart cameras that are multiple times more expensive than legacy cameras, city and county governments can host DL models on gateways and on-premise servers. This allows data to be processed and stored at the edge, providing faster response time than relying on cloud infrastructure. The second is 5G. While network slicing won't be commercially ready by 2023, the network slicing capability of 5G allows communication service providers to offer dedicated network resources to host microservices, six nines reliability service assurance, seamless device connectivity, and onboarding to support DL-based machine vision in the smart city,"" Su explains. ""The shift to edge computing opens new market opportunities, especially for AI chipset startups that focus more on processing at gateways and standard servers such as companies Blaize, Hailo, and Kneron."" Nonetheless, significant headwinds abound. Public trust and regulations related to adopting AI in public cameras is a big challenge facing their implementation. The public and human right advocates around the world are wary of misuse and have been pushing back against the adoption of facial recognition technologies. The use of facial recognition is even banned by city councils in the United States. As one of the key markets for DL-based machine vision technology, China has been under heavy scrutiny over its nationwide rollout of facial recognition technology to maintain national security and public order, particularly in ethnic minority territories.""Trust is a critical component in public safety technologies. ABI Research encourages developers, vendors, authorities and the general public to focus on constant dialogue and the introduction of common technology platform for transparency, as well as AI ethic and governance frameworks that can minimize biases. Moving forward, the technology vendors that are successful in the smart city are those which will be able to demonstrate transparent and explainable DL models and those who show willingness to embrace open and common standards and ethical frameworks,"" concludes Su.These findings are from ABI Research's Deep Learning-Based Machine Vision in Smart Cities application analysis report.

Increasing Pressure on Improving Crop Yields & Lowering Cost of Production Drives Adoption of Smart Agriculture Technologies, Creating a US$ 18.7 Billion Opportunity.The global market for Smart Agriculture is projected to reach US$ 18.7 billion by the year 2027, trailing a post COVID-19 CAGR of 9.4% over the analysis period 2020 through 2027.The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in large scale disruptions in supply chains across the world in the first half of 2020. Lockdowns, closures and other measures adopted by authorities worldwide led to severe operational constraints for farm equipment manufacturers. Numerous production sites of agriculture equipment manufacturers faced delays and interruptions in the supply chain, along with labor shortage and low customer activity.Most of the production facilities were suspended owing to supply chain disruptions. The delay in production and shipment further resulted in drop in retail sales. With the COVID-19 outbreak unfolding on a global scale, disruptions in food supply chains, income and remittance losses, and effects of other shocks on agriculture sector have become clearly evident, thereby creating food security risks in many countries across the world. Although global food prices continue to be mostly stable, varying levels of food price inflation is being observed in several nations at the retail level because of the measures taken to contain COVID-19 transmission.In the post COVID-19 period, the agriculture industry is set to undergo notable transformation due to the continuous influx and implementation of new concepts and technologies. The shift is expected to help farmers in revolutionizing operations for better yields, environmental gains and less wastage. AI holds immense potential to help the agriculture industry to become smarter and efficient while reducing waste. COVID-19 outbreak has accelerated the adoption of AI-powered technologies in the industry. Agriculture professionals are realizing notable benefits of using drones for tasks like seeding, field surveying and spraying while keeping farmers safe.Drone flights in the agriculture industry have increased 32% over 2018-2019, indicating increasing focus on drones. In addition, increasing agricultural automation is anticipated to further drive the trend and transform farm practices.Emerging technologies such as AI and automation are likely to help farmers in ensuring smart planting, while integration of drone software in equipment management is expected to support analysis of conditions. AI-powered solutions are being widely used for detecting weeds, water issues, nitrogen deficiencies and pests to remediation like spraying of herbicides and pesticides. Advanced solutions leverage AI along with cameras on crop sprayers for detecting and spraying agrochemicals with high degree of precision.In addition, drone-based data can be used for detecting deficiency of specific elements to inform sprayers of deficient areas only. These applications are anticipated to help farmers in boosting overall productivity and yields without leaving impact on the environment. In countries across the world, there are also several educational initiatives that educate growers on the new technologies and their benefits.In Canada, the initiative of Olds College Smart Farm for instance aims at transforming previous farm operations of the campus through use of new solutions and technologies. The college installed stationary soil monitors, wireless grain bin sensors and digital weather stations on the farms. It used ML, AI and data analytics and turned data into useful information. The college is also planning on educating its students on new agri tech.The global agriculture industry is also being revolutionized by blockchain technology, which is enabling farmers to track crops, digitally and in the real time. The technology is able to record and also update crop status through the entire production time, from planting upto delivery. There would be limited cases of load losses. The technology can also reduce inefficiencies in supply chain, fraud instances and recalls because of its capability of tamper resistance. It also allows tracking of ownership records.Farm automation or smart farming is another futuristic technology for the global agricultural industry. It refers to use of big data, PoE (power over Ethernet), IoT, cloud and other sophisticated communication technologies for automating operations of agriculture. Such automation reduces the need for labor and increases efficiency of operations and quality of the goods.Automation streamlines all processes of farming by eliminating repetitive, manual tasks. GPS, soil scanning, automatic watering, data management, temperature sensors, self-driving machinery like seeders and tractors are some of the features of smart farming. Another major technological innovation, becoming common in the global agriculture industry, is the drones. Bees are essential for farming as they help pollinate crops. Without the pollination crops cannot be fertilized for seed production.Drones, particularly the smaller ones, are being increasingly used for pollinating crops in areas where bee populations are dwindling. Drones have several other applications. They are being used in automating crop harvests and crop growth monitoring. They provide growers with aerial views of their vast fields.Key Topics Covered: I.

WeMore news about: Lytx, Inc.","Lytx, Inc.","SAN DIEGO, March 16, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Lytx®, a leading provider of machine vision- and artificial intelligence-powered video telematics, analytics, safety, and productivity solutions for commercial, public sector, and field service fleets, today announced Doughnut Peddler, a national wholesale bakery and fresh food distribution company, has signed on to deploy the new Lytx SF300 DriveCam® Event Recorders with the Driver Safety Program and Fleet Tracking Service across its fleet of more than 250 vehicles, protecting over 350 drivers. Founded 35 years ago, Doughnut Peddler has a significant footprint across the United States with 18 distribution centers and five bakeries that serve over 3,800 locations daily and make 1.4 million stops per year. Doughnut Peddler chose Lytx after a three-way competitive trial, including a side-by-side trial of Lytx and another in-cab dash cam in the same vehicle. In addition to reducing its insurance rates – a major factor in Doughnut Peddler's initial consideration of video telematics – the company experienced a number of safety improvements, including:54% reduction in overall risk 58% reduction in speeding 50% reduction in cell-phone use 46% reduction in drivers unbelted 44% reduction in instances of unsafe following distances""We own all of our trucks and want to protect our assets from damage and our drivers from collisions and faulty insurance claims,"" said William Cooper, national director at Doughnut Peddler. ""We were impressed to find such an advanced solution that is able to assist us with driver training, driver coaching, exonerations, fleet tracking and real-time video search, and can integrate with the other applications and devices we already use for a seamless, centralized view of our fleet operations. Lytx's program was superior to anything else we saw in the market."" Confidence-inspiring Technology and Support Made the Decision Simple Doughnut Peddler has been experiencing rapid growth in recent years, expanding operations from one state to 13 states in just five years and hiring new drivers to support them. The accelerated pace and geographic expansion required a better solution to reduce liability and manage a larger fleet operating daily in three time zones. Doughnut Peddler set out to find a video-based fleet solution that would help management identify and coach risky drivers before they were involved in a collision or costly claim and help train the influx of new drivers joining its fleet.Once Doughnut Peddler experienced the unmatched risk detection capabilities of Lytx's SF300 DriveCam Event Recorders, its intuitive back-end solution for locating and accessing video clips and Lytx's exemplary customer service, Cooper says choosing Lytx was an easy decision. The SF300, Lytx's latest event recorder, uses state-of-the-art machine vision and artificial intelligence (MV+AI) to detect risky driving behaviors and issues customizable, audible in-vehicle alerts that help drivers self-correct in the moment.""Lytx's machine vision and AI was a major factor in our decision. We were confident in the information it captured and alerted our drivers to in the cab – a feature that has helped reduce risky driving significantly and empower our drivers in the process. Lytx's machine vision and AI have also saved our supervisors from sifting through irrelevant video, which quite frankly, they don't have the time to do and we don't want to ask of them,"" Cooper said. ""The other device missed critical incidents, which worried us, and we were not confident we could trust it out in the field.""Cooper continued: ""Lytx's customer service added to our confidence. The Lytx team became an extension of ours, with support staff always a phone call or email away. This was in stark contrast to the competition, which had us waiting sometimes for weeks."" All-in-one Solution and Open API Streamlines On-boarding and Provides Maximum VisibilityDoughnut Peddler is also utilizing Lytx's open API system architecture to connect the Driver Safety Program and Fleet Tracking Service with its proprietary driver application used for assigning and tracking deliveries, identifying driver-to-vehicle assignments and more. With Lytx's Fleet Tracking layered on top, Doughnut Peddler's dispatch team can now see how long drivers are in and out of delivery locations and access real-time video, which helps optimize efficiencies, ensure on-time deliveries and allows the team to verify driver reports at any hour. The company also uses Geotab's Electronic Logging Device and is utilizing Lytx's Geotab integration to streamline all of its fleet management platforms into one centralized location, leveraging the power of Lytx's all-in-one solution offering. ""The ability to navigate Lytx's online platform and access 24/7 video was night and day compared to the competitor. Lytx has its solutions and integrations so dialed-in that anyone can easily use its system. The fact that we could easily integrate it with our current software applications and devices made this a grand slam,"" Cooper said.

Letter Ride provides last-mile delivery services for DHL and is one of the fleets leading the burgeoning industry forward in adapting video telematics to address the sector's unique safety challenges. ""We are a young company in a young industry, so the challenges we have faced are unprecedented,"" said Letter Ride owner Roman Lara. ""As our fleet has grown exponentially, we've experienced a faster pace of business and stretching our resources. Through these changes, the Lytx Driver Safety Program has helped us meet the rigorous demands of the same-day delivery business and face safety challenges in the moment with in-cab alerts, helping us keep our drivers — and the communities we serve — safe.""Pain Points for a Rapidly Growing FleetSince its founding in 2016, Letter Ride's fleet has grown to over 500 vans, operated by 1,000 drivers. This has largely been a result of the booming e-commerce industry, and further buoyed by stay-at-home orders creating a reliance of delivery of essential goods. For Letter Ride and other fleets in the courier industry, this rapid increase in demand has come with unique challenges: even with a rigorous hiring and training process in place, Letter Ride's growing fleet is increasingly made up of younger and less experienced drivers. For a fleet operating largely in residential areas, safety must be a top priority and so proactive, real-time driver safety tools are essential.With that knowledge, Lara saw an opportunity to go the extra mile to make Letter Ride's fleet as safe and well protected as possible, and sustain the challenges of the competitive last-mile industry. ""Within the first few days of our trial with Lytx, we saw a Letter Ride driver as the cause of cell phone-related near-collision,"" said Lara. ""From the get-go, we quickly realized this was only the tip of the iceberg. The video-based alert and coaching program has helped us tackle these underlying concerns and build a safer, more sustainable and more competitive fleet."" Partnering with Lytx to Create a Safer Future In early discussions with Lytx, Lara saw the hardware, powered by proprietary machine vision and artificial intelligence (MV+AI), working together with Lytx's industry-leading analytics to provide the precise insights his fleet needed to become safer and prevent collisions. With this MV+AI functionality, the Lytx DriveCam® Event Recorders are able to detect more risk factors than traditional telematics systems, flagging not only things like speed violations or hard braking but also distracted driving behaviors like cell phone use or lane departure. These technologies and algorithms are powered by Lytx's industry-leading database of over 100 billion driving miles, providing precise risk detection and alerts at the moment when they are needed most. As part of the Driver Safety Program, Lara and his fleet are using in-cab alerts to flag risky behaviors in real time, so drivers are equipped to self-correct the behavior as it occurs — and proactively prevent collisions and other adverse outcomes. ""The in-cab alerts have changed the safety game for us, providing a tool for drivers to recognize their unsafe habits in the moment,"" said Lara. ""I've been able to work closely with the Lytx team in customizing the program to flag the most critical challenges for my fleet, like cell phone use, rolling stops and lack of seatbelt use, so drivers are able to focus on the most relevant risk factors and make corrections accordingly. With the Lytx alerts, drivers develop an awareness of how often they are partaking in risky behaviors and the vast majority have been empowered to make changes to these habits in the long term.""Assuaging Insurance ConcernsBecause many of its vehicles bare the logos of big names like DHL, Letter Ride also found itself susceptible to high rates of claims against its drivers. Combined with aggressive growth and the fast-paced nature of the business, Letter Ride was facing concerns about high insurance rates. Insurance companies have seen the challenges last-mile fleets face and, as a result, have placed high rates on coverage for these companies. For Letter Ride, deploying Lytx technology changed all of that.""With so many associated risks, insurance companies are wary of covering delivery companies like Letter Ride and often charge rates that are far higher than the companies can afford,"" said Cody Ritchie, president and owner of Crest Insurance, who brokered Letter Ride's most recent insurance renewal. ""When a fleet deploys Lytx's technology — which has been proven to improve safety and cost savings time after time — insurance companies see a commitment to safety and are far more willing to work on a more favorable coverage policy together.""Indeed, since deploying, Letter Ride has seen not only achieved improvements in safe driving, but also overall cost savings from accidents and worker claims. The Lytx DriveCam Event Recorders have allowed the management team to ensure drivers are complying with company policy and quickly prove when an accused driver was in the right; the video evidence provides objective views in what otherwise could be expensive claim processes for both Letter Ride and their insurance provider. ""With a deep history of supporting safe driving, Lytx has been an exceptionally valuable partner in recognizing risk in real time, keeping our insurance rates under control and maintaining the safety of the communities we serve,"" said Lara. ""We are proud to be making an industry-leading stride towards safer and more reliable last-mile driving services and I am hopeful that other courier fleets will follow in our footsteps to make the roads safer for everyone.""About Letter Ride Letter Ride, LLC is a delivery company dedicated to satisfy their customers and partners' needs.

ThisMore news about: Huawei","Huawei","SHANGHAI, Feb. 23, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- At the 5G Advanced Summit hosted by the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) during Mobile World Congress Shanghai 2021, Dr. Tong Wen, Huawei Fellow and CTO of Huawei Wireless, delivered a keynote speech titled ""Continuous 5G Evolution for Building an Engine of All-Industry Digitalization"". In his speech, Dr. Tong emphasized that 5G must continuously evolve to build an engine of all-industry digitalization so as to satisfy the fast-growing consumer connections and diverse industrial applications.5G Evolution Speech @ MWC 2021 by Dr. Tong Wen, Huawei Fellow and CTO of Huawei Wireless5G development accelerates, driving 5G networks to improve performanceA new communication technology generally dominates for a decade, evolving to provide stronger capabilities, before being superseded by the next generation. In the past year, 5G has been evolving at a faster rate, showing its massive potential. The continuous improvement of experience in customer connections and enrichment of Internet of Things (IoT) services raise the requirements on connection capabilities. ""The ever-increasing demand for wireless connections is the fundamental driving force to continuously advance mobile technologies,"" said Dr. Tong.Therefore, 5G must constantly improve its capabilities. Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) services are driving a significant upsurge in data demand, requiring 5G networks to increase capacity to guarantee premium experience. With the introduction of reduced capability (REDCAP), massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC) services will be available on more terminals to fulfill the massive diverse IoT requirements. Ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) services require networks to reduce transmission latency and provide latency-guaranteed connection services so as to meet the high-quality connection requirements of remote and programmable logic controller (PLC) control.5G must expand its boundary of capabilities to open up a new space of businessAs new applications keep emerging in the market, the three use cases originally defined in 5G need enhancement to meet diverse IoT service requirements. The boundary of 5G capabilities must be expanded to open up a new space of business.Immersive interaction services are rapidly developing. 5G AR/VR has enabled superior virtual experience. With the rise of lightweight XR devices, 5G XR will also become a reality. This requires 5G to be further enhanced to deliver premium immersive experiences. 5G networks will be required to increase its average speed from 120 Mbps to 2 Gbps as high definition improves from 4K to 16K. To ensure real-time interaction in the virtual world, 5G must also further reduce transmission latency from the current 20 ms to 5 ms.Uplink-centric networks are accelerating industrial digitalization. Currently, 5G applications are growing at an unprecedented rate, raising the requirements on uplink speeds. Various consumer AR/XR services require high-definition images and videos to be sent from local devices to clouds for further rendering. Remote control and machine vision in industrial applications also require real-time transfer of 4K and 8K videos. This will lead to a considerable increase in the proportion of uplink traffic over 5G networks to above 40%. To deal with such a huge amount of uplink traffic, 5G uplink capabilities must be improved by at least 10 times.In addition, 5G must provide sensing capabilities to empower remote control, vehicle-road synergy, unmanned transportation, and smart logistics. For example, by introducing cellular Massive MIMO's beam sweeping to sensing technologies, both sensing and communication, and even indoor high-precision positioning services, can be implemented through wireless technologies.5.5G will become an engine of all-industry digitalizationBased on its abundant practices while helping realize the prospects in the mobile industry, Huawei has proposed 5.5G to contribute to exploring new applications, including uplink centric broadband communication (UCBC), real-time broadband communication (RTBC), and harmonized communication and sensing (HCS), with the aim to build an engine of all-industry digitalization.""Both technology and business are essential to stimulate and promote the development of an industry. The mobile industry, the world's largest wireless connection market, reaches trillions of US dollars every year,"" said Dr. Tong. ""The accelerating integration of 5G with various industries will create a new market space worth more than US$10 trillion."" Due to the lack of collaboration between the connection technologies of industrial services, the applications are often limited to just a single or several applications, far from a scaled effect. As a result, the market is worth just billions of US dollars. The continuous evolution of 5G will improve network capabilities and expand service scenarios, adding extra support for achieving the integration while reducing the cost of connections. This will help unleash the potential business opportunities worth over US$100 billion in the IoT industry.""The innovation of technologies and applications will open up infinite possibilities for 5G evolution in the next decade,"" Dr. Tong concluded. ""The wireless communications industry cannot achieve success without unified standards and industrial collaboration. Together, we should define 5G evolution and promote industrial collaboration to accelerate the maturity of technology and build a sustainable future with 5G.""--END--About HuaweiHuawei is a leading global provider of information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure and smart devices.

This fleet tracking market report evaluates fleet tracking technologies, solutions, and ecosystems including major players. The report assesses the impacts of various use cases and specific considerations in terms of asset technology and solution selection.The report also analyzes the outlook for the fleet tracking market globally and regionally. Quantitative data and forecasts include market segmentation by Mode (Air, Roadway, Railway, and Water), Fleet Type (Services, Transport, Taxi, Special Purpose), Vehicle Type (Car, Container, Rail, Plane, Ship, Truck, Van), Industry Verticals and Region from 2021 to 2026.Select Research Findings:Fleet is rapidly moving to a cloud-based support approach, especially with edge computing Fleets are largely not connected today, representing a huge upside for the fleet management market Largely untapped SMB market that segment represents 72% of the market, but 68% have no telematics Leading fleet management companies are moving clients towards a transaction-based self-service model Integrating artificial intelligence algorithms provides opportunities for value-added fleet management servicesFleet tracking refers to the processes that fleet managers use to manage their fleet and asset information. This tracking enables companies to reduce overhead, improve overall efficiency, and ensure that standards are met across an entire fleet operation. Fleet tracking allows for smaller operations to expand more easily, providing greater visibility into a company's many moving parts.Fleet tracking can be used in a variety of industries, including service and delivery fleets, electric/oil/gas, auto repair/roadside assistance, mobile sales teams, garbage/utility/public works, and contractors. Fleet tracking may be used in a variety of use cases including the following:Response to Safety Incidents: If a vehicle in a fleet is involved in a collision or other accident, fleet tracking allows for immediate notification to the company. Managers can almost instantly view data about the incident, including location, time, and even whether the driver accelerated/braked safely. Fleet tracking not only aids in accident cleanup but can also prevent them from happening in the first place. Prevention of Safety Incidents: Fleet tracking can record unsafe driving behaviors and alert drivers/ managers to the behavior. Using GPS technology, it can be determined if a truck is speeding, cornering too sharp, braking too hard, etc., and accidents can be prevented before they ever occur. Improving Customer Service: Customers are used to their packages arriving when a company tells them they should. Fleet tracking in logistics allows for constant knowledge of a package's location and expected delivery time based on variables such as time and traffic. This tracking not only provides the customer with greater peace-of-mind, but also gives managers greater oversight and control over their operation. Decrease Downtime: Fleet businesses rely on their vehicles to be ready to go at a moment's notice. When a vehicle is out of commission, a company loses money. Fleet tracking provides managers with live alerts to maintenance issues, including vehicle fault codes. Real-time data and solutions help to solve a problem before it is created, reducing vehicle downtime, and increasing business productivity.A subset of the overall asset tracking market, the fleet tracking market represents those solutions that leverage various technologies (GPS, M2M/IoT, embedded and adjunct devices, on-board and remote computing, etc.) to provide solutions for tracking land-based commercial wheeled or tracked motor vehicles including trucks, trailers, vans, cars, special-purpose vehicles, and other fleet assets. Land-based fleet tracking also includes private cars, trucks, and vans used for business purposes. The fleet tracking market also includes air-based (drones, fixed-wing aircraft, and helicopters) and water-based craft (tankers, container vessels, ferries, etc.).Historically speaking, the fleet tracking market has largely served two primary purposes: (1) Improving operational efficiency and (2) Supporting regulatory compliance. Regarding the latter, important metrics include location, average speed, acceleration/deceleration, incident reporting (such as when brakes are applied and duration), engine malfunctions, drive time, and other data useful for fulfilling both regulations as well as legal and business requirements in the event of a claim against services, condition of goods, damages or injury.Regarding operational efficiency, the fleet tracking market is rapidly evolving to provide solutions to improve the ability for fleets to effectively fulfill their mission in the most cost-effective and safe manner possible, while maintaining client satisfaction and corporate goodwill. This includes everything from seamless payload/personnel transfer to proper accounting for care-of-custody, billing, and overall service fulfillment.The broader scope of the fleet tracking market includes aviation machinery (including drones, planes, helicopters, and ground support equipment), railway equipment (locomotive, railcar, and support machinery), and shipping (government/military fleets, tankers, containers, etc.). Roadway and other land-based vehicles often operate in substantially different environmental conditions between industries and businesses. They also have different needs, constraints, and use cases than those of watercraft and aerial vehicles.While the fleet tracking market has made great strides towards automation and ease of use for the fleet owner, commercial fleets remain largely unconnected today. To minimize the impact of interconnecting a fleet, leading fleet management companies such as Momentum IoT are reducing end-user friction through user-friendly, self-service fulfillment that is transaction-based and highly intuitive. This is moving the fleet tracking market from a higher cost and complex marketplace to one that is lower cost and simpler to manage.Certain leading companies such as Spireon are looking beyond simply fleet tracking for compliance reasons, logistics, and asset monitoring. Data analytics is an important part of value-added fleet tracking solutions. By way of example, data associated with vehicle detention (such as fleet delays at the location point of delivery), may be analyzed with data analytics programs to determine potential operational changes ranging from procedures, policies, assets, and personnel modifications.Other leading companies are leveraging various IoT solutions such as Roambee, which utilizes automated smart sensors and analysis via cloud data analytics to track shipments and inventory on a dynamic basis including real-time location and condition reports. These types of solutions provide a direct benefit to enterprise and industrial customers as well as many indirect benefits across the entire supply chain including producers, distributors, wholesalers, retailers, and ultimately consumers.In terms of self-driving vehicles, we see autonomous solutions fulfilling the role of what some fleets do today. This will occur initially in the area of shipping/logistics, beginning with short distance and regionally focused operations including food delivery, transportation, self-service errands, and product delivery. By way of example, Kroger delivers groceries with an autonomous vehicle solution. We see car and drone-based food delivery as the tip of the iceberg as the unmanned vehicle ecosystem evolves with goods transport as a high ROI solution for the autonomous systems market.Target Audience:AI companies M2M and IoT companies Logistics services companies Systems integration companies Fleet management service providers Asset tracking software and services companiesKey Topics Covered: 1.0 Executive Summary2.0 Introduction2.1 Fleet Tracking Overview2.2 Fleet Tracking Business Drivers2.3 Fleet Tracking Technologies and Integration3.0 Fleet Tracking Solution Considerations3.1 Tracking Vehicle Utilization3.1.1 Hours of Service3.1.2 Idle Time vs. Usage3.1.3 Vehicle Lifecycle Management3.2 Vehicle Monitoring3.2.1 Tracking Location and Boundaries3.2.2 Speed, Acceleration, and Proximity3.3 Fleet Tracking Data Analysis and Analytics4.0 Fleet Tracking Solutions4.1 Vehicle Tracking4.2 Commercial Fleet Tracking4.3 Autonomous Vehicle Fleets and Tracking4.3.1 Navigation and Mapping4.3.2 Machine Vision and Motion Planning4.3.3 Trajectory Control4.3.4 Video Camera and GPS System4.3.5 Traffic Detection and Assistance4.3.6 Sensing Systems: Ultrasonic, LIDAR, and Others5.0 Fleet Tracking in Industry Verticals5.1 Aviation and Aerospace5.2 Automotive and Transportation Systems5.3 Government (State and Local)5.4 Robotics and Drones6.0 Vendor Ecosystem and Company Analysis6.1 Vendor Ecosystem6.1.1 Original Equipment vs. OEM Vendors6.1.2 Asset Leasing and Lending Companies6.1.3 Vehicle Manufacturers6.1.4 Hardware Providers (GPS, Devices, others)6.1.5 Software and Application Developers6.1.6 Service Providers including Fleet Management as a Service6.2 Select Company Analysis6.2.1 Azuga Fleet6.2.2 Blackberry (Radar, QNX)6.2.3 Carmalink6.2.4 ClearPath GPS6.2.5 DriveFactor (or CCC Drive)6.2.6 Estrack6.2.7 Fleet Safety Institute6.2.8 Fleetilla6.2.9 Fleetistics6.2.10 FleetManager6.2.11 FleetMind (Safe Fleet Holdings)6.2.12 Fleetup6.2.13 Geotab6.2.14 Globalstar6.2.15 Go Fleet6.2.16 GPS Insight6.2.17 GPS Trackit6.2.18 GSAttrack (Global Satellite Engineering)6.2.19 Gurtam6.2.20 Inseego6.2.21 IntouchGPS (GPSTrackit)6.2.22 Lojack6.2.23 Lytx6.2.24 M2M in Motion6.2.25 Mix Telematics6.2.26 Momentum IoT6.2.27 NexTraq (Michelin)6.2.28 Omnitracs6.2.29 Passtime6.2.30 Pedigree Technologies6.2.31 Raven Connected (KlashWerks Inc.)6.2.32 Rhino Fleet6.2.33 Roambee6.2.34 SafeFleet6.2.35 Samsara6.2.36 Skybitz6.2.37 Smart Path GPS6.2.38 Spireon Inc.6.2.39 Sprint Corporation6.2.40 Teletrac Navman6.2.41 Tenna6.2.42 T-Mobile6.2.43 TomTom International BV6.2.44 Verizon Wireless6.2.45 Vodafone Limited6.2.46 Zonar Systems (Continental AG)6.2.47 Zubie7.0 Fleet Tracking Market Analysis and Forecasts 2021 - 20267.1 Global Asset Tracking Market 2021 - 20267.2 Fleet Tracking Market 2021 - 20267.2.1 Fleet Tracking Market Drivers7.2.1.1 Improving Efficiency and Productivity7.2.1.2 Reducing Vehicle Investment Risks7.2.1.3 Government Regulations and Compliance7.2.1.3.1 Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration7.2.1.3.2 Other Regulations7.2.1.4 Safety and Sustainability7.2.1.4.1 Location Traceability7.2.1.4.2 Usage and Maintenance7.2.1.5 Logistics Optimization7.2.1.5.1 Tracking and Tracing7.2.1.5.2 Route Planning and Navigation7.2.1.6 Additional Connected Vehicle Related Market Needs7.2.1.6.1 V2X and Collision Prevention7.2.1.6.2 Other IoT Integration Market Drivers7.2.2 Fleet Tracking Industry Verticals and Business Types7.2.2.1 Enterprise7.2.2.1.1 Commercial Fleets7.2.2.1.2 Short and Long-haul Trucking7.2.2.2 Industrial7.2.2.2.1 Material Handling Vehicles7.2.2.2.2 Special Purpose Vehicles7.2.2.3 Government7.2.2.3.1 Public Safety Vehicles7.2.2.3.2 Special Use Vehicles7.2.3 Fleet Tracking Market Forecasts7.2.4 Fleet Tracking Market by Non-Roadway Based Vehicle Type7.3 Fleet Tracking Market by Unit Deployment 2021 - 20268.0 Conclusions and RecommendationsFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/r2q7pa Research and Markets also offers Custom Research services providing focused, comprehensive and tailored research.Media Contact:Research and Markets Laura Wood, Senior Manager [email protected] For E.S.T Office Hours Call +1-917-300-0470 For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call +1-800-526-8630 For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900 U.S. Fax: 646-607-1907 Fax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716 SOURCE Research and Markets Related Links http://www.researchandmarkets.com"

Een jaar later blijft het systeem leren en verbeteren. LOUISVILLE, Colo., 29 januari 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- IdentiFlight® is blij om te kunnen vermelden dat een onafhankelijk onderzoek, ""Geautomatiseerde inperking van windturbines vermindert het aantal adelaarsdoden "", onlangs in de Journal of Applied Ecology gepubliceerd werd. Uitgevoerd door The Peregrine Fund, in samenwerking met Western EcoSystems Technology, Inc. en de US Geological Survey, op een windmolenpark in Wyoming, toonde het onderzoek aan dat het gebruik van het IdentiFlight-systeem tot 82% minder dode adelaars heeft geleid. ""Vogels die tegen draaiende turbinebladen botsen zijn al geruime tijd een zorg in de windmolenindustrie. De technologie die IdentiFlight heeft ontwikkeld om vogels te herkennen, is ontwikkeld om dit probleem aan te pakken en het succesvolle samenleven van wilde dieren in het wild en windenergie te bevorderen"", aldus Ben Quinn, Senior Vice President bij IdentiFlight. ""We hebben nu overtuigend bewijs dat IdentiFlight kan worden gebruikt als een oplossing om in huidige en toekomstige windmolenparken het aantal dodelijke slachtoffers onder vogels tot een minimum te beperken.""Dr. Chris McClure, directeur van Global Conservation Science bij The Peregrine Fund en hoofdauteur van dit onderzoek, merkte op: ""Deze resultaten tonen aan dat het gebruik van het IdentiFlight-systeem het aantal dodelijke slachtoffers van adelaars in windmolenparken aanzienlijk kan verminderen, waardoor het spanningsveld tussen het opwekken van windenergie en de roofvogelbescherming ook vermindert. Aangezien deze technologie zich blijft ontwikkelen en verbeteren, heeft het de potentie om wereldwijd roofvogels tegen windmolens te beschermen."" Voortdurend evoluerende technologie Het IdentiFlight-systeem wordt commercieel ingezet bij projecten over de hele wereld en heeft actief meer dan 2,2 miljoen afbeeldingen van arendsporen opgespoord en gedocumenteerd. Het aantal gedocumenteerde afbeeldingen neemt elk jaar met meer dan 10 miljoen toe en er worden meer dan 47 miljoen afbeeldingen van beschermde soorten verzameld. Bij elke afbeelding wordt het IdentiFlight-systeem nauwkeuriger en betrouwbaarder.Carlos Jorquera, Chief Technology Officer voor IdentiFlight, verklaarde: ""Een van de voordelen van het IdentiFlight-systeem is het vermogen om te leren van de enorme hoeveelheden gegevens die het dagelijks wereldwijd over adelaars en andere beschermde vogelsoorten verzamelt.

We zijn enthousiast over de toekomst van IdentiFlight en kijken ernaar uit om te blijven aantonen dat natuur en windmolens naast elkaar kunnen bestaan.""Hoe IdentiFlight werkt Het IdentiFlight-systeem combineert kunstmatige intelligentie met uiterst nauwkeurige optische technologie om adelaars en andere beschermde vogelsoorten te detecteren. Gepatenteerde software en neurale netwerktechnologieën verwerken de beelden binnen enkele seconden na detectie om 3D-positie, snelheid, traject en vast te stellen om welke beschermde vogelsoort het gaat. IdentiFlight-torens werken als een autonoom systeem dat specifieke windmolens detecteert, classificeert en inperkt die een risico voor de vogel kunnen vormen. Het systeem detecteert een vogel tot op een kilometer afstand en classificeert deze vogel als een beschermde soort zoals een adelaar (of niet) in realtime. De IdentiFlight-torens kunnen zodanig worden gepositioneerd dat ze meerdere windmolens in één windmolenpark binnen hun bereik hebben. Wanneer ze worden geïnstalleerd als een netwerk met overlappende luchtdekking, werken de systemen samen om de vogels in het gebied zo goed mogelijk te beschermen. Over IdentiFlight IdentiFlight verkoopt, levert en exploiteert machine vision en AI-technologie voor de detectie van vogelsoorten en is een product van Boulder Imaging. In een actief werkend windmolenpark draagt IdentiFlight bij aan het behoud van vogels door adelaars te beschermen tegen botsingen met draaiende bladen van windmolens. Het systeem biedt geïnformeerde inperking van specifieke windmolens om energieverlies te verminderen. Bij de ontwikkeling van windmolenparken helpt IdentiFlight bij het toelaten van locaties door op potentiële locaties nauwkeurig de activiteiten van de vogel in kaart te brengen.

Conventional manufacturing setups have been exposed to traditional industrial robots over the years that have gained widespread adoption globally. However, there is a growing demand for worker safety in factory settings, increasing need of manufacturing industries to match market demands and a burgeoning requirement for businesses to remain competitive, which have laid the foundation for the adoption of modern manufacturing methods such as collaborative robots.Collaborative robot solution manufacturers are leveraging the convergence of several enabling technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine vision, and advanced gripping technologies in robots making them safe to work with thereby disrupting traditional robotic solutions as well expanding robotic use cases to laboratories, healthcare, semiconductor wafer handling, and assembly. Also, collaborative robots solutions have provided manufacturing flexibility in terms of being able to quickly adapt to line changeovers and newer tasks owing to easy programming and manual guiding training techniques making them immediately deployable.User comfort is the need of the hour laying the foundation for advancements in robotics. Cobot advancements are leading to increased user safety, reduced strain on humans, and lesser effort required from human labor. In the development of collaborative robot solutions, there are several influencing factors to be considered, which will in turn aid in the disruption of current technologies that are indeed cumbersome to use. It is critical to ensure the right balance between technology advancements, expansion of product portfolios to increase application diversity, and strategies to innovate for example: collaborating with universities to develop more user-friendly and easy to maneuver robots as well as in the development of lighter robots. The publisher's analysis indicates that despite being able to cater to a variety of industrial applications, collaborative robots technology is yet to reach small and mid-sized industries, which are just beginning to explore automation.The fourth industrial revolution can be realized to its full potential with the awareness created about cobots through effective marketing and by adopting robots-for-hire which are easy-to-afford business models that will expand the reach of the technology. Major collaborative robot arm manufacturers are focusing on expanding their global footprints through traditional business models such as direct sales through distribution centers while few are tying up with robot rental third-party solution providers. However, the new age autonomous cobot providers are leaning toward the robots-as-a-service model, which have proven to be favorable in providing a far-reaching impact of the technology within a short span.Key Topics Covered: Strategic Imperative and Growth EnvironmentStrategic Imperative Growth Environment Collaborative RobotsCompanies to Action:ABB, Switzerland AUBO Robotics, US Cobalt Robotics, US Diligent Robotics, US FANUC, Japan Fetch Robotics, US Flexiv, US Kinova Robotics, Canada KUKA, Germany Locus Robotics, US Universal Robots, US Yaskawa-Motoman, JapanStrategic InsightsNext Steps: Leveraging the Report to Empower Key StakeholdersSignificance of Being on the Report Empowers the CEO's Growth Team Empowers Investors Empowers Customers Empowers the Board of DirectorsAnalyticsBenchmarking Future Growth Potential Legal DisclaimerFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/51a9omResearch and Markets also offers Custom Research services providing focused, comprehensive and tailored research.Media Contact:Research and Markets Laura Wood, Senior Manager [email protected] For E.S.T Office Hours Call +1-917-300-0470 For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call +1-800-526-8630 For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900 U.S. Fax: 646-607-1907 Fax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716SOURCE Research and Markets Related Links http://www.researchandmarkets.com"

The offering, available within Lytx Compliance Services, helps fleets easily identify, reconcile, and manage unassigned drive time through automatic reporting, driver assignments, and notifications, adding to Lytx portfolio of all-in-one fleet solutions.Lytx Unassigned Drive Time simplifies the burden of managing unassigned vehicle movements in compliance with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's (FMCSA) Electronic Logging Device (ELD) mandate, which states that any time a vehicle moves, a carrier must assign the time to the correct driver or note why a driver-to-vehicle assignment was not possible. Vehicle mileage and/or drive time that is not assigned to a driver, labeled ""Unassigned Driving Time,"" have been challenging for fleets to reconcile on their own and, if unaddressed, put carriers at risk for substantial fines.""Managing these unassigned events is an added responsibility for both carriers and drivers, and one that cannot be ignored, as was the case prior to the ELD mandate,"" said Lytx's Senior Director of Compliance Services, Rick Walters. ""We've seen a variety of our clients, across industries and fleet sizes, struggle to manage and reconcile their unassigned drive time. In an effort to offer solutions for all fleet needs, we developed the Lytx Unassigned Drive Time Service to save these fleets countless hours and help them free up in-house resources that can be redirected toward more complex, higher-value tasks, while reducing their exposure to risk, litigation outcomes and impacted safety ratings.""With Lytx Unassigned Drive Time, Lytx accesses a fleet's ELD data to run the unassigned driving time report and uses that information to determine a probable driver. An assignment notification is sent to the driver to accept; a decline triggers a notification to a manager for further investigation. An automatic report is generated and sent daily, which helps keep fleet managers informed and compliant. NFI Industries Saves Two Hours a Day Per Fleet Manager with Lytx Unassigned Drive Time NFI Industries, a fully integrated North American supply chain solutions provider with more than 4,200 drivers, deployed Lytx for its compliance needs in 2004 and has grown alongside the company over the last decade and a half. The company was looking for a solution to handle unassigned driver time at its various freight terminals across the country. Many times, the company's fleet managers did not know if it was a driver or ""spotter"" at the terminal moving a truck or payload around between trailer pick-ups and drops, and there was a massive backlog that needed to be assigned.""Anytime Lytx comes out with a new service, we jump at the opportunity to see how we can use it to improve compliance,"" stated Julie Jones, director of safety compliance, NFI Industries. ""We immediately saw improved efficiencies with Lytx Unassigned Drive Time,"" added Lee Robledo, vice president of safety compliance, regulatory and investigations, NFI Industries. ""And now our managers save roughly two hours per day by not having to spend time investigating unassigned events and associating them with the appropriate drivers. It's been invaluable.""Staying on top of unassigned drive time and other compliance requirements has helped reduce the risk of regulatory fines and litigation exposure. With NFI's full deployment of Lytx Compliance Service's proactive alerts, detailed reporting, and automated workflows, NFI has saved valuable time and is able to monitor potential violations in real time. ""This has allowed us to address red flags, such as an HOS violation, immediately and proactively, giving us the chance to correct the violation,"" Robledo noted. ""And if we were to be audited, having Lytx Compliance Services in place gives us greater credibility with the auditor, as it shows we have systems in place to help us stay within compliance."" About LytxLytx is a leading provider of machine vision and artificial intelligence-powered video telematics, analytics, safety, compliance, and productivity solutions for commercial, public sector, and field service fleets. Our solutions harness the power of video to empower drivers and fleets to be safer and more efficient, productive and profitable so they can thrive in today's competitive environment.

Both AGVs and AMRs collectively are going to cross the installed base of 1.5 Million in next 5 years to make the mobile robots a new normal in our day-to-day operational activities.Mobile Robots (AGV and AMR Market) are enabling the optimization of space in warehouse facilities in logistics and manufacturing and can reduce the need for new and costly green field fulfillment and distribution centers.While new centers are still being built, they are being built with robots and other automation in mind. Even these robotic systems are flexible and can be added or removed as per the requirement. But we are witnessing new applications of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR) and Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) apart from logistics and manufacturing due to advancement in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Vision, manipulation capabilities for automatic picking and placing, and robotic mechanics.Study CoverageThis post-pandemic AGV and AMR business research is first and exclusive market study covering new emerging applications like Healthcare, Disinfection, Retail and Inventory Management, Security and Inspection, Agriculture, Hospital Assistance, Indoor and Outdoor Delivery, Cleaning, Tele-presence and Tele-operation, and Data Platforms & Remote Sensing apart from old revenue sources like Logistics and Manufacturing.The market study contains analysis of more than 500 players, Key Navigation Technologies, Major Form factors & Functions, Targeted Industry Verticals and applications and 15+ geographical countries/regions. Analysis is validated through 50+ in-depth interviews across the value chain with components and technology providers, system integrators, robot manufacturers, and end-user industry verticals.Apart from this, the study also focused on different components and integral parts of AGV/AMR like Motion Control, Batteries & Chargers, Cameras/Vision Sensor, LiDAR, Sensor Fusion, QR Code and Wireless Communication. Market size and forecast database is also available in excel format to analyse and strategize further. It is a best reference to analyse the market attractiveness, to identify the partner, customer or supplier, to check the competitive landscape, to benchmark the new technologies and to select the right geography & industry vertical for your products and services.Voice and opinion of end-users have been taken as the key parameter for this market forecast.Top Factors & ChallengesAutomation is the key focus in manufacturing and logistics sector as a part of Industry 4.0 and Supply Chain 4.0 initiatives for continuous growth and sustainability. Robotics is an important aspect of this automation. Growth in e-commerce is the main driver for AGV/AMR demand in warehouse automation. Global e-Commerce sales have grown at a CAGR of 20% over the last decade, reaching ~$3.5 trillion worldwide in 2019, and expected to grow to ~$7.5 trillion by 2026. The share of online retail sales has gone from ~2% of total to ~13%, and is further expected to reach ~22% by 2026. High personnel costs and wage rates are especially high in the developed countries. Annual costs for a forklift operator can run up to $50,000. If a forklift has to be operated around the clock, then at least 3-4 drivers are needed. Adding the invest costs of $10,000 for a forklift truck to the personnel costs, the annual costs for one forklift come to over $200,000. Artificial Intelligence and Deep learning are also at a tipping point and are already disrupting multiple industries and will definitely impact the way warehouses are operated currently. In 2017, RightHand Robotics unveiled a solution called RightPick that can pick items at a rate of 500 to 600 per hour, at par with a human worker. Machine learning and artificial intelligence will impact logistics automation well beyond machine vision's benefits to picking technology, by greatly enhancing the flexibility and ease-of-use of a wide range of automated systems. RaaS and different leasing options are reducing upfront investment as end-users are not having enough CapEx for pilot runs to validate the RoI. Now there are the options like Pay Per Pick, Pay Per Mile, Pay Per Peak Day etc. to balance your OpEx and RaaS cost. Safety Challenge - The evolution of AGV/AMRs over the last 15 years has created a broad range of machines and markets. Everything from AGV/AMRs in the warehouse to the home. One of the key chasms in the world of AGV/AMRs is the safety requirement differences between ""service"" AGV/AMRs and ""industrial"" AGV/AMRs. While the intent is that no AGV/AMR harm a human, service robots operate in the realm of the human beings. Working environments for service robots might include operation in a grocery store, a retail store, a mall, a hospital, on the sidewalk or in the home.AGV vs AMRIn our study, we have considered Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) where movement is highly structured and monolithic in static environment with the help of magnetic strips or wires. If there is any obstacle in the path then it has to be removed to make AGV in motion again. Re-deployment of guided technology like magnetic strips or wires is required with an additional cost if there is a change in the facility like renovation, upgrade or change in location.Opposite of AGV, Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) works in dynamic environment with autonomous navigation. It creates and saves the locations or map of the facility to find the alternative path if there is an obstacle in the defined route. Also, it requires minimum changes as there is any change related to facility as AMR can be just unboxed and put to work within one hour if it's already mapped with the facility. It's extremely flexible to deploy.AGV and AMR Market HighlightsIndustry witnessed a good growth despite of pandemic and is supposed to registered ~$2.5B sales in 2020. Around 60,000 mobile robots (AGVs & AMRs) are expected to shipped in 2020. United States, Germany, U.K., China and Japan are going to lead the market with an annual demand of more than 200,000 mobile robots (AGV & AMR) by 2026 China is supposed to be hub for Autonomous Mobile Robots, both in terms of demand and supply as It is expected that Made In China AMRs will be 30%-40% more economical due to labour cost advantages and huge volume consumption in China itself. AMRs are supposed to grow with a CAGR of ~45% between 2020 and 2026 and are going to be more attractive market as compared to AGVs by 2026 with relatively more shipment and TAM share. After QR code - LiDAR, Vision Cameras and Sensor Fusions are the key navigation technologies to be commercialized in this space due to flexibility, safety concerns and higher accuracy. Even Sensor Fusion AMRs are expected to grow with ~70% growth rate. There are dedicated companies (Autonomy Service Providers) for navigation technology and software who are supporting mobile robot manufacturers to build such capabilities with the help of AI and Machine Vision. Hospital and Retail are two emerging applications to target with ~50% growth apart from logistics and manufacturing.Key Players AnalyzedAGV & AMR: Geek+, Quicktron (Flashhold), ForwardX Robotics, GreyOrange, HikRobot (HikVision), Mobile Industrial Robots - MiR (Teradyne), inVia Robotics, River Systems - 6RS (Shopify), Fetch Robotics, JATEN, IAM Robotics, Locus Robotics, Vecna Robotics, Waypoint Robotics, Tompkins Robotics, Scallog, OTTO Motors (Clearpath Robotics), GIDEON Brothers, Magazino GmbH, NextShift Robotics, AutoGuide Mobile Robots (Teradyne), EiraTech Robotics, Aethon (ST Engineering), BLEUM, HAI Robotics, Bionic HIVE, Oppent, PAL Robotics, Matthews Automation Solutions (Matthews International), GUOZI Robotics, CAJA Robotics, Omron (Adept Technology), Guidance Automation (Matthews International), Syrius Robotics, MALU Innovation, Eurotec (Lowpad), DS Automation, Mitsubishi Logisnext Europe Oy (Rocla), NeoBotix, John Bean Technologies (JBT Corporation), Transbotics (Scott Group), CSG Huaxiao, EK Automation, OCEANEERING, Wellwit Robotics, Logistic-Jet, SEEGRID, BALYO System Integrators (SI): Daifuku, Dematic (KION Group), SSI-Schaefer, Vanderlande (Toyota Advanced Logistics), Swisslog (KUKA), Knapp, Murata Machinery Ltd., Elettric 80, Beumer Group, Witron Logistik + Informatik, TGW Logistics, Grenzebach GmbH, FIVES Group, Honeywell Intelligrated, Bastian Solutions (Toyota Advanced Logistics), Material Handling System (MHS), Jungheinrich AG, LODIGE Industries, ViaStore Systems, Interlake Macalux, Kardex, AutoStore, DMW&H, Westfalia, Dambach AG, PSB intralogistics GmbH, SIASUN Robot Automation Co., Ltd., SAVOYE, OPEX Corporation, System Logistics (Krones Group), GUDEL Autonomy Service Providers (ASP): Brain Corporation, Bluebotics, KOLLMORGEN, Autonomous Solutions, Inc.

Using Robotic Process Automation (RPA), natural language processing (NLP), machine learning and machine vision, Notable scans the EHR for unvaccinated patients that meet federal/CDC and state recommendations, and configurable criteria such as age or comorbidities.More news about: Notable Health","Notable Health","SAN MATEO, Calif., Jan. 14, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Notable Health, the leading intelligent automation company for healthcare, announced today it has extended its platform capabilities to support automating COVID-19 vaccine administration workflows. US healthcare systems face a massive logistical challenge in identifying patients who meet state or federal criteria for receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, and engaging with these patients to schedule as effectively as possible. Health systems can now use Notable to automatically identify eligible patients and educate them on how to receive the vaccine. This enables health systems to support more rapid administration of vaccines to their patient population.Notable's intelligent automation platform enables providers to proactively identify and engage the right vaccine candidates at the right time; educate them on how, when and where to receive the vaccine and automate follow up appointment scheduling and reminders to receive the second dose.Notable's end-to-end platform automates hundreds of repetitive administrative and clinical workflows, such as patient outreach, clinical intake, documentation and billing. Since the start of the pandemic, more than 280,000 automated COVID-19 pre-visit screenings have been performed using Notable's COVID Triage solution. More than 3,400 high-risk ambulatory patients were identified through Notable's platform and rerouted to the appropriate care modality, such as telehealth or urgent care. Now, the platform can be used to proactively engage the right vaccine candidates at the right time.""There has never been a vaccination effort as accelerated or complex as this one. Demand for the COVID-19 vaccine is high but supply is limited, so precise health risk assessment will remain key to a successful roll out. Configurable technology solutions such as Notable can help providers automate and streamline complex workflows like vaccine administration, especially as supply begins to catch up with demand,"" said Muthu Alagappan, MD, medical director at Notable Health. ""Intelligent automation can enable health systems to effectively support their communities, especially in the coming months as each state's unique needs evolve.""With Notable, providers can:Identify patients for vaccination based on risk factors and contraindications (I.e.: ""Are you currently pregnant?"", ""Do you have any of the following chronic health conditions?"") Keep patients informed about when and where to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, such as the locations of designated administration sites. Export vaccine administration records to the EHR so that providers can track which of their patients still need to be vaccinated. Remind patients when they are due for their second dose, to ensure maximum vaccine efficacy. Using Robotic Process Automation (RPA), natural language processing (NLP), machine learning and machine vision, Notable scans the EHR for unvaccinated patients that meet federal/CDC and state recommendations, and configurable criteria such as age or comorbidities. Based on eligibility, Notable initiates a digital pre-visit screening, collects informed consent, and schedules necessary follow up appointments. For providers directly administering the vaccine, Notable increases their overall capacity to vaccinate more patients, faster, by screening for risk factors and collecting informed consent before a patient arrives onsite.

With data captured from fleets of all sizes and types within the trucking industry, Lytx's 2020 report reveals the riskiest states, cities and roadways in the United States along with the riskiest days and times and trends in risky driving behaviors. ""2020 was an unforgettable year with unprecedented challenges for the trucking industry. With the continued demands facing fleets and drivers, it has never been more important for us to identify and share key areas of risk and opportunities to help improve their safety,"" said Dave Riordan, executive vice president, Lytx enterprise business. ""We use our dataset – the largest and most accurate of its kind – to identify and address top areas of driving risk, and to provide trucking fleets with insights they can put into action quickly to improve their safety."" Identifying Riskiest Areas Across the CountryLytx captured over 10 million risky driving incidents among trucking fleets in 2020. From all those incidents, Lytx examined single-square-mile road segments using its proprietary risk scoring system and found the following areas in the U.S. had the highest concentration of risk:Allentown, Pa.: Interstate 78, East of W. Emaus Avenue Lambsburg, Va.: Interstate 77, near Old Pipers Gap Road Albuquerque, N.M.: Interstate 40, near Coyote Springs Road SE Durham, N.C.: Interstate 85, near University Station Road Lebanon, N.J.: Interstate 78, near Cokesbury RoadAs in past years, most of the identified riskiest road segments are near interchanges, construction zones, or on/off ramps, which increase driving risk. According to Lytx's risk score system, these five road segments, on average, are 152 times riskier than the average road segment in Lytx's trucking-industry database.""We know sudden lane changes and shifts in driving speed surrounding interchanges can create a more volatile driving environment and more opportunity for dangerous incidents,"" said Del Lisk, Lytx's vice president of safety services. ""We urge fleets and drivers to be aware of the increased risk in these areas and level-up their caution and defensive driving in these situations, whether you are passing through one of the segments featured here or any other highway interchange.""Areas of Pennsylvania, and Allentown in particular, have been featured on this list in past years, with the top two riskiest roads in 2019 and top three riskiest roads in 2018. That said, Pennsylvania improved in the overall state rankings in 2020. The riskiest states for trucking fleets in in 2020 were: California Washington Texas Oregon GeorgiaThese states overall were three times riskier than the 45 other states in Lytx's nationwide footprint. Lytx also examined its data in 60-by-60-square-mile areas and, for the second year in a row, identified Chicago as the riskiest U.S. city for trucking. Compared to the next riskiest city, Dallas, Chicago was 23% more risky, likely related to its role as a major transportation hub for routes in all directions.""With a wealth of driving data paired with unmatched analytic capabilities, Lytx is able to determine driving risk and drill that down into specific cities or even intersections,"" said Lisk. ""While we know trucking routes may not always be flexible, we encourage managers and coaches to consider these areas of concentrated risk in supporting their drivers to approach every situation with a proactive, safety-oriented mindset."" Riskiest Days and Times for Truck DriversLytx found slight shifts in the days of the week and times with the highest prevalence of collisions and near-collisions. From 2018 to 2020, Lytx identified the following:2020 2019 2018 Day of week with most collisions Tuesday Thursday Wednesday Day of week with fewest collisions Sunday Monday Monday Time of day with most near collisions Morning (5:00 a.m.- noon) Morning (5:00 a.m. – noon) Afternoon (noon – 5:00 p.m.) ""With 24/7 demand for deliveries necessitated by the pandemic, we've observed a shift in the days of the week with the most and least collisions,"" said Lisk. ""Compared to past years, fleets may have more routes and deliveries early in the week, rather than starting the week slowly. This could be a factor in Sunday having the fewest collisions and Tuesday having the most collisions."" Trends in Risky BehaviorEven with increased demand in 2020, Lytx trucking clients showed strong improvements in several key, high-risk behaviors, including: Behavior (in order of most improved) Improvements from 2019 Late response -77% Following distance: ≥ 2 sec to < 3 sec -51% Red light -38% Unsafe lane change -38% Drowsy driving -29% Compared to other fleet types, trucking showed strengths in several areas, including: Behavior Comparative Frequency* Loose object in cab 68% less often Distraction related to electronic device 59% less often Positive recognition, which occurs when the driver had a close call that wasn't a result of their own actions and prevented potentially significant consequences by exercising safe driving practices and/or when the driver demonstrated courteous driving 33% more often *As compared to Lytx's other client segments: waste, distribution, transit, government, construction, concrete, utilities and field services. ""Trucking professionals are clearly working hard to proactively approach safety to protect themselves and the communities they serve,"" said Lisk. ""For drivers spending long hours on the road and driving longer distances than other transportation-adjacent industries, this is a remarkable feat.""Lytx's data also found these risky behaviors increasing among truck fleets:Behavior (in order of frequency) Change from 2019 Posted speed violation Increasing Incomplete stop at stop sign Increasing Failed to stop at stop sign Increasing ""We share this information as an opportunity to shed light on the areas where drivers, managers and coaches should pay special attention in order to approach safe driving proactively,"" said Riordan. ""From recognizing when and where truck drivers may face more risky behaviors or higher collision rates to understanding exactly which behaviors are proving challenging for the industry, we hope these unique insights from Lytx can help the trucking industry stay informed as drivers head out on the roads this year. We maintain our commitment to helping fleets raise the bar for safety as we continue to innovate our machine vision and artificial intelligence capabilities to uncover even further insights about driving risk in the trucking industry.""About the Data These insights were derived from Lytx's proprietary database of trucking driving data from 2019 and 2020, including more than 10 million risky truck driving events captured last year. For comparisons across industries, Lytx calculated behavior averages from its global database, which contains driving data from utilities, distribution, concrete, construction, services, transit, government and waste industries. Lytx maintains the fastest-growing proprietary database of professional driving data in the world, currently surpassing 120 billion miles of driving data. The data is anonymized, normalized and in instances of behavior prevalence, is generalizable to trucking fleets at large.About Lytx Lytx is a leading provider of machine vision and artificial intelligence-powered video telematics, analytics, safety, and productivity solutions for commercial, public sector, and field service fleets.

COVID-19 Gives Industrial Automation & IIoT Special Significance. Industrial PCs Indispensable for Control & HMI to Reach $5.7 BillionThe global market for Industrial PCs is projected to reach US$5.7 billion by the year 2027, trailing a post COVID-19 CAGR of 4.7% over the analysis period 2020 through 2027. Industrial PCs (IPCs) are personal computers which are employed for industrial processes. IPCs are therefore constructed to withstand use in industrial environments, which are characterized by dust, extreme temperatures, moisture, humidity, noise, power spikes, and vibration. Efficient and steady performance in tough environments is the main advantage offered by these PCs, with the potential to function in the temperature range of -40C to +80C. They generally comprise robust cooling fans in addition to dust filters and are more flexible in comparison to commercial PCs. The growing need for automated process control has been spurring demand for industrial PCs. Industrial PCs leverage sophisticated instruction sets including x86. As compared to personal PCs, industrial PCs have a higher cost and are more efficient, reliable, consume lesser power, and have a prolonged service life. Industrial PCs use less power, as they function on batteries such as nickel metal hydride, nickel cadmium, or renewable sources such as wind or solar energy.Industrial PCs are mainly employed for data acquisition and/or process control purposes. In certain areas, such PCs are employed as a front-end for another control computer within a distributed processing environment. While customized software can be used for a specific application, off-the-shelf packages such as LabView, Labtech Notebook, Wonder Ware, or TwinCAT can also be employed for basic programming. The market in the post COVID-19 period is expected to benefit from the re-doubled focus shed on industrial automation and process control. Adoption of automation technology enables enterprises to gain from improved quality of manufactured products, superior employee work efficiency, increased yield and reduced material wastage, and savings on capital and operating costs. Besides the ongoing coronavirus crisis, the worldwide industrial sector is facing several other pressing challenges in the form of volatile raw material prices, harsh regulatory scenario, globalization-driven issues, and decreasing profitability. In order to stay competitive, manufacturers are increasingly focusing on improving the efficiency of their operations and productivity by modifying and modernizing their production processes and infrastructure. Manufacturers are leaning towards automation of processes and systems that facilitate plant supervisors, managers, and engineers and workers monitor and manage plant operations in a more efficient and resourceful manner.To reap the benefits of automation, process engineers are deploying advanced Machine Vision, Human-Machine-Interface (HMI), Machine-Machine Interface (MMI), IoT Control & Data Aggregation technologies embedded with dedicated Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition Software (SCADA) that aid in gaining complete control over complex operations and processes. Machine Vision and HMI infrastructure systems have already become common in programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and industrial control panels as these tools provide technicians the capability to select and finalize a pre-planned result from the automated equipment and its application. By deploying HMI, PLC, industrial control panels, machine vision and other technologies, industrial entities can automate various functions such as turn on/off industrial valves, sensors, and alarms; view and monitor critical data in dashboards; control IoT devices and machines; execute push messages, repots, and KPIs; and turn mechanical operations into visual processes to identify and diagnose problems, among others. Against this backdrop, sophisticated industrial computing technologies such as embedded PCs are gaining traction. With industrial automation, 'Smart Factory', Industrial IoT, and M2M communication converging to revolutionize the level of intelligence on plant floors, the demand for embedded and other types of industrial PCs is poised to grow strong in the coming years. Panel IPCs and Rack Mount IPCs are the two largest segments of Industrial PCs, together accounting for over 48% of the market. In addition to being the largest, the Panel IPC market is also growing at the fastest rate over the analysis period. Demand for DIN Rail IPCs is also anticipated to grow at a strong rate owing to their features such as compact design and varied I/O modules. These computers are customized based on the manufacturing process' complexity. DIN rail IPCs mainly find application in medical, industrial, transportation and traffic, and military sectors. Adoption of these IPCs is rising due to growing focus on enterprise networks and connected factory among manufacturing organizations, and the rising need for efficient movement of information across production units.Competitors identified in this market include, among others:Advantech Co., Ltd.

Researchers concluded that PixCell's HemoScreen™, a miniature, easy-to-use, AI and machine vision-enabled hematology analyzer, can fill the gap in point-of-care (POC) diagnostics.The paper, titled A Novel Approach to Hematology Testing at the Point-Of-Care, compares the traditional analysis methods used for blood cell counting to the new imaging flow cytometry method used by the HemoScreen. It shows that imaging is superior to the conventional methods by its ability to better differentiate between cells and being more robust in coping with different interferences that are known to affect standard hematology analyzers. ""One of the most common tests that assists in diagnosing infection is a simple complete blood count (CBC). Despite the CBC being the most performed blood test in the world, and one that can immediately inform clinical decision making, it is still mostly restricted to the lab,"" said Prof. Robert Christenson of the University of Maryland, Scientific Advisory Board Member for PixCell and co-author of the study. ""Making this test accessible, inexpensive and accurate at the point-of-care would significantly improve clinical workflow and stem the spread of disease. We found that the HemoScreen can fill this gap.""The HemoScreen™ is designed to be simple for users. It requires no maintenance or calibration, nor any technical expertise to operate. Using the HemoScreen™, the entire CBC testing process entails three steps from sample collection to results delivery. A single drop of blood is collected in PixCell's disposable ""lab-on-a-cartridge"" which is outfitted with all necessary reagents, the cartridge is inserted into the HemoScreen, and within 6 minutes, the device provides lab-accurate results for the full 5-part differential CBC, including 20 parameters and comprehensive abnormal cell flagging. ""The CBC is extensively used to manage COVID-19 patients' disease progression and clinical decision-making, such as transfer to ICU, intubation and patient antibiotic regimes. Yet, there is currently no suitable POC option for this most common test,"" said PixCell Medical CEO and co-author of the study, Dr. Avishay Bransky. ""The HemoScreen is the first established and FDA-cleared hematology analyzer for POC use by non-technical users. This study demonstrates that the HemoScreen™ can deliver lab-equivalent results rapidly, at the point-of-care, making it the ideal solution to improve workflow. This can minimize the spread of disease, particularly in the pandemic management reality in which we currently find ourselves."" The HemoScreen leverages AI and computer vision, combined with PixCell's patented Viscoelastic Focusing (VEF) technology, which causes cells to line up in a single cell plane for rapid analysis and can be utilized in primary care, oncology, Intensive-Care-Units (ICUs), Operating Rooms (ORs) and Emergency Departments (EDs).About PixCell MedicalPixCell Medical provides the first truly portable point-of-care blood diagnostic solution. Leveraging the company's patented Viscoelastic Focusing technology, along with AI-powered machine vision, PixCell's FDA-cleared and CE-marked HemoScreen diagnostic platform shortens diagnostic results delivery from days to minutes. With just one drop of blood and within six minutes, PixCell delivers accurate readings of 20 standard blood count parameters, saving patients, clinicians and health systems significant time and costs.

The rebrand reflects the company's commitment to its customers and better aligns with the company's position in 5G and broad-spectrum IoT wireless risk and cost management. The new name and brand reflect the comprehensive breadth of the company's services and expertise across 5G wireless, operational technology (OT), and IoT. Through the LOCH Wireless Machine Vision™ Platform, LOCH provides solutions that support the growing number of 5G smart connected devices being used by its customers, across critical infrastructure organizations, like oil, gas and energy, healthcare and smart manufacturing organizations, as well as government agencies.

""The market continues to evolve with the adoption of Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS), the anticipated rollout of 5G and satellite, as well as advancements in wireless standards. These innovations enable our customers to implement IoT in an expanded number of locations and use cases. We play a critical role in safeguarding connected devices and networks and helping to manage their cost and performance in this new hyperconnected world amid growing security and privacy concerns with the proliferation of attack methods, new vulnerabilities, and expanded attack surface.""IDC: 41.6 billion connected IoT devices generating 79.4 zettabytes (ZB) of data by 2025Wireless and IoT devices continue to proliferate globally as end-users, businesses, and government agencies come to expect round-the-clock internet connectivity for personal and professional devices. IDC estimates that there will be 41.6 billion connected IoT devices generating 79.4 zettabytes (ZB) of data in 2025. Both ""users of things"" and ""makers of things"" understand that, and according to David Reinsel, SVP of IDC's Global DataSphere, ""With every new connection comes a responsibility to navigate and manage new security vulnerabilities and privacy concerns."" But ensuring effective security and management for billions of devices connected over wireless networks is far from assured today. Traffic is growing from both corporate and personal IoT devices that continue to put businesses at risk and shadow IoT continues to be a growing issue. Vendors of these systems have been building physical products for many years but they've never had to consider the implications of securing them as they connect to the network and other systems. It's not uncommon for vendors to ship devices that aren't as secure as they should be. Even when they do build adequate security into their products, users don't always configure them properly, which can lead to security vulnerabilities. While everything will soon be connected wirelessly, most technology vendors and wireless carriers approach wireless and IoT device management with partial solutions that only provide support for a limited array of devices on their networks or the radio frequencies on which they operate. As a result, enterprises often have little visibility into the cost, performance and security vulnerabilities of the thousands of wireless devices that may operate in their environments. In this new world of ""wireless everything,"" innovative organizations are finding new ways to harness the potential of wireless ubiquity and machine-to-machine connections to propel their businesses forward. Technologies like 5G and satellite will significantly enable the potential of IoT devices by boosting data transport speeds and reducing data latency. The situation becomes more complicated with the increase in remote workers and the adoption of smart home technology. IDC also estimates that there will be over one billion 5G devices, representing about nine percent of global mobile devices by 2023. These remote sensors and smart devices will radically increase the complexity of securing corporate networks from intruders and cybercriminals. And the amount of data created by 5G networks will make it much more difficult to spot anomalies in user behavior from hackers.Today's security solutions are limited in the breadth and depth of protection they provide. In most cases, they provide support for Wi-Fi protocols and networks as an extension to their wired infrastructure, completely disregarding newer protocols that are becoming more popular. Many also require software to be installed and run on the wireless endpoints, but that, too, is a problem since many low-energy devices can't support that. As a result, anyone looking to secure the various wireless solutions making their way into the workplace would have to deploy multiple security solutions to keep up. ""Billions of new wireless devices are coming online every year to automate our homes, cars, factories, and cities, and they are introducing new levels of security risks. This additional attack surface has to be discovered, monitored, and secured,"" said Richard Stiennon, chief research analyst at IT-Harvest.LOCH Wireless Machine Vision Platform | Comprehensive visibility, management and security for IoT networksThe LOCH platform, an artificial intelligence platform that connects all IT devices to identify the first line of defense and implement a line of defense prior to exploitation, provides security, performance monitoring, and cost management for all 5G, broad-spectrum, and CBRS environments.

This is a perfect fit for manufacturers who need to upload videos in machine vision and massive broadband IoT, accelerating the intelligent upgrade of industries. UCBC can also greatly improve user experience with mobile phonesMore news about: Huawei","Huawei","SHANGHAI, Nov. 16, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- At the 2020 Global Mobile Broadband Forum (MBBF), David Wang, Huawei's Executive Director, gave his keynote speech: ""Defining 5.5G for a Better, Intelligent World"". Wang said that 5.5G will be an evolution of 5G and that he looked forward to working with industry partners to define 5.5G. Together, Wang said, they can improve real-time interaction experience for individual users, enhance cellular IoT capabilities, and explore new scenarios, including Uplink Centric Broadband Communication (UCBC), Real-Time Broadband Communication (RTBC), and Harmonized Communication and Sensing (HCS), for a better, intelligent world.David Wang speaks at 2020 MBBFEach generation of mobile communications technology has reigned for about a decade, before being superseded by a new standard. 5G will be the major mobile communications technology until 2030 and will likely be in service until 2040. The development history of 2G, 3G, and 4G over the past 30 years shows that, even within each generation, continuous evolution is necessary to fully unleash the potential of the technology and advance the development of the industry.Connecting people is the basic function of 5G. Mobile networks were first created to keep people connected, anytime and anywhere. Between now and 2030, 5G will increasingly help people interact with the virtual world in real time and deliver a truly immersive experience. 5G-empowered VR/AR has made interaction between the physical and virtual worlds a reality. However, to deliver an XR Pro and holographic experience, cellular communication will have to provide higher speeds: The average access speed will need to increase from the 120 Mbit/s that supports today's 4K video streaming to the 2 Gbit/s necessary for 16K video. In addition, lower interaction latency will be needed; the current 20 ms will need to be brought down to 5 ms. To meet all these requirements, 5G needs to keep evolving.Connecting things is a major extension of 5G. Huawei's vision and mission is to bring digital to every person, home and organization for a fully connected, intelligent world. Connectivity and computing will be the building blocks of this intelligent world, and 5G will be the most critical connectivity technology. Looking ahead to 2030, cellular networks will carry more than 100 billion connections, and most of them will be carried by 5G. This is orders of magnitude higher than the 1.3 billion IoT connections we have today. 5G needs to keep evolving to meet the ever more diverse and complex needs of IoT across all scenarios.The experience of connection between people needs to be improved and scenarios of connection between things need to be further refined. In preparation for the day when 5G will support 100 billion connections, Huawei has proposed its vision for 5.5G. The company will shape the development and evolution of the 5G industry, inject more vitality into 5G, and create new value for the development of our societies and industry upgrades.""5.5G is our vision for the industry. It is an enhancement and extension of the three standard 5G scenarios defined by the ITU – eMBB, mMTC, and URLLC,"" noted Wang.The introduction of REDCAP means more device types will be available, providing the diverse range of devices needed by broadband IoT in the mMTC scenario. Optimizations in latency with a certain level of reliability allow for smart manufacturing like remote motion control in the URLLC scenario. As industry intelligent upgrades accelerate, a diverse range of IoT use cases will emerge and 5G use cases will also diversify. For example, some use cases require both massive connections and super large uplink bandwidth; some need communication and sensing capabilities. Therefore, 5.5G will cover three more scenarios than 5G: UCBC, RTBC, and HCS.""Going beyond the original three application scenarios to six, 5.5G will take us beyond the Internet of Everything, enabling the intelligent Internet of Everything,"" said Wang.The new scenarios enabled by 5.5G will create new value for social development and industry upgrades.First, UCBC will accelerate the intelligent upgrade of industries. Built on the foundation of 5G capabilities, UCBC will enable a 10-fold increase in uplink bandwidth. This is a perfect fit for manufacturers who need to upload videos in machine vision and massive broadband IoT, accelerating the intelligent upgrade of industries. UCBC can also greatly improve user experience with mobile phones in indoor scenarios, with its deeper coverage and larger uplink capacity.Second, RTBC will deliver an immersive, true-to-life experience. RTBC supports large bandwidth and low communication latency. The goal is to deliver a 10-fold increase in bandwidth with a given latency and a certain level of reliability. By achieving these goals, we can give users an immersive experience when they interact with the virtual world.Third, HCS enables autonomous driving. HCS is designed to enable connected cars and connected drones, scenarios in which autonomous driving is the key requirement. By applying the beam scanning technology of Massive MIMO to the sensing domain, HCS can offer both communication and sensing functions. In indoor scenarios, HCS is capable of providing location services.Fourth, sub-100 GHz usage pattern needs to be restructured to maximize the value of spectrum. To realize the industry's vision, 5.5G needs to use more sub-100 GHz spectrum for full-band uplink and downlink decoupling and full-band carrier aggregation on demand.Fifth, with AI, 5G networks have limitless intelligence. The 5G era will see more frequency bands, and more types of devices, services, and customers than any previous generation. 5.5G needs to fully integrate with AI to address all these complexities.Wang concluded his speech by saying, ""Unified standards and industry collaboration are the core DNA that shapes the success of the global wireless communications industry. The development of 5.5G requires collaboration between all parties up and down the value chain.""On behalf of Huawei, Mr. Wang put forward three proposals.First, all industry stakeholders should start working on 5.5G within the 3GPP framework as soon as possible.Second, the industry should work together to drive a thriving 5.5G industry ecosystem by making the most of sub-100 GHz spectrum to provide diversified network capabilities and devices and overhaul cellular IoT.Third, the industry needs to further integrate 5G into verticals to create more use cases and accelerate digital and intelligent transformation.Huawei looks forward to working with industry partners to define 5.5G and build a better, intelligent world.At the 2020 Global Mobile Broadband Forum, Huawei will share insights into global industry trends and hot topics with carriers, regulators, partners, and media analysts from around the world. They will explore how innovation in ICT technologies such as 5G and AI can be mutually beneficial to industries and society at large.

Among all kinds of AI technologies, the computer vision AI technology is undoubtedly a breakthrough point to open the intelligent future. From driver assistance system to IoT equipment, from national economy to the people's livelihood, computer vision has been widely used in various industries.As a battleship in the deep sea of computer vision, NextVPU is building intelligent solutions from both the hardware and software sides based on its AI chip products and the algorithm deployment platform Infer Studio™. With the help of the Infer Studio™ platform, NextVPU's N1 series chips successfully support the simultaneous running of 11 AI algorithms in a consumer product.Curiously, how is this result achieved? What benefits does the AI solution based on NextVPU's N1 series chips and Infer Studio™ platform bring to customers? Among many AI chip players, what kind of product design ingenuity does NextVPU rely on to establish its own competitive edge?Alan Feng, founder and CEO of NextVPU, unveiled the unique technologies of NextVPU's computer vision AI chips and the Infer Studio™ platform.1. Computer Vision Solutions with Hardware and Software IntegratedAs revealed by Alan Feng, NextVPU's R&D team currently has more than 200 staff, of which the ratio of hardware engineers to software engineers is about 1:2.2. Based on the self-developed CVKit™ NN IP, NextVPU has developed an AI chip matrix for different market segments, such as camera, vehicle, 3D vision, and launched the AI application development platform Infer Studio™.In the AI chip matrix, NextVPU released three computer vision chips (N163, N161, and N160) this year to provide 2.4 TOPS, 1.2 TOPS, and 1 TOPS computing power, respectively. These chips can meet various requirements of machine vision, intelligent cameras, ADAS and AIoT markets. The Infer Studio™ platform can help customers who without AI-related experiences quickly deploy AI & vision algorithms.As told by Alan Feng, NextVPU's N1 series chips are not pure AI co-processors but highly integrated SoC chips, which are different from common computer vision chips on the market. This means that N1 series chips not only provide the basic computer vision chip functions such as signal sampling and signal processing, but also support more functions.""Our chips adopt a very heterogeneous architecture. With excellent performance on signal sampling and signal processing, our chips also integrate a variety of peripheral interfaces and support many types of memory modules. Generally, N1 series chips are very comprehensive and robust SoCs"", he said.In addition, Alan Feng shared his opinion that only a highly integrated computer vision SoC was not enough to meet the market demand and the efficiency of hardware support for AI algorithms needed to be improved to extend AI algorithms to practical applications. He said, ""to put what customers' desire into chips and selling them the chips is not realistic, and vendors actually need to bear a deep understanding of the applications and extension of AI algorithms.""Infer Studio™ platform improves the efficiency of algorithm deployment by supporting not only neural network operations but also general mathematical methods. In practical applications, it would meet the requirements of fast iteration of user algorithms.2. N1 Series Chips: Speed & Accuracy are the key performance metrics. All AI applications are looking for ideal AI chips that achieve the balance among performance, power consumption, and cost. AI chips are measured from several aspects, such as the computing performance that can be obtained per dollar, the performance that can be obtained per kilowatt-hour (KWH) of electricity, the cost of algorithm deployment, and the stability and reliability of the chip itself. Among them, the computing power of each TOPS claimed by chip vendors corresponds to the actual number of frames processed per second (such as pictures or videos), and it is crucial to maintain the accuracy of the algorithm in the conversion from neural network model training to model deployment.As shared by NextVPU, according to the test results of N161 chips on different neural networks, the number of pictures inferred by N161 chips per second per TOPS demonstrates an industry-leading level. In addition, the N161 chip also shows its robust performance on supporting the FP16 precision network.When running neural network algorithms, benefiting from the brand-new architecture of CVKit™ NN IP, the CPU on the N161 chip does not participate in the calculation (the CPU usage is constantly less than 1%). Therefore, the computing power of the CPU has been completely reserved for customers to use.In terms of computing performance, NextVPU recorded the running results of the N161 chip on 9 neural networks, and compared the result with an industry flagship chip on 5 neural networks. As shown in the comparison results, the N161 chip outperforms the flagship chip on all 5 neural networks of ResNet-50, MobilleNetV1, MobilleNetV2, MobilleNetV1-SSD, and YOLOV3.In addition to the computing performance, the computing precision is also a key indicator for measuring an AI chip. This is because the loss of accuracy caused by data type conversion will increase the cost in the process of neural network model training and deploying the model.Taking Unmanned Retail Machine as an example, if the precision of the object(goods in this context) recognition algorithm decreases by 1% in actual application, the loss rate and the operation cost will increase significantly.NextVPU recorded the test results of the N161 chip running on the 7 neural networks under the precision of PC NCNN FP32 and N161 board-level INT8, and calculated the precision loss when the model was quantized from FP32 to INT8.According to the test results on the 7 networks, all the precision loss of N161 quantization from FP32 to INT8 is less than 1%. Therefore, the N161 chip supports the direct deployment of algorithm models on the FP16 network without precision loss.Test Network NetworkSize PC NCNN FP32 Precision Board-End INT8 Precision GoogleNet_V1/Inception v1 224x224x3 top_1= 0.661top_5= 0.884 top_1= 0.653 top_5= 0.886 mobilenetv1 224x224x3 top_1= 0.698top_5= 0.904 top_1= 0.695top_5= 0.903 mobilenetv2 224x224x3 top_1= 0.713top_5= 0.895 top_1= 0.711 top_5= 0.892 resnet18 224x224x3 top_1= 0.664top_5= 0.889 top_1= 0.670 top_5= 0.886 resnet50 224x224x3 top_1= 0.743top_5= 0.926 top_1= 0.743top_5= 0.921 SENet-R50 224x224x3 top_1= 0.760top_5= 0.936 top_1= 0.763top_5= 0.935 squeezenet_v1.1 227x227x3 top_1= 0.577top_5= 0.796 top_1= 0.577 top_5= 0.798 Almost no precision loss for the N161 INT8 quantization network3. Infer Studio™: Resolving the Pain Points of Algorithm DeploymentThe challenge of AI Deployment, on the one hand, is that the whole industry urgently requires ""right"" chips with excellent performance, cost, power consumption, on the other hand, to deploy the AI algorithm in the applications demands high cost caused for acquiring proper AI expertise and skills. Currently, the latter has become a growing problem for AI deployment in the whole industry.To solve this problem, NextVPU has launched the AI application development platform Infer Studio™. Infer Studio™ can ""translate"" an algorithm into a file that the chip can ""read"" so that the algorithm can be deployed quickly. In this way, it provides developers with ""one-click"" development experience.Taking an ADAS(Advanced Driver Assistance System) project as an example, in order to monitor whether a driver talks, phones, or dozes when driving a vehicle, the system needs to monitor the driver's eye status and whether the driver has a phone by his or her ear. Generally, it takes at least one week to deploy such an algorithm into the embedded system. In contrast, with the help of the Infer Studio™ development platform, the algorithm can be compiled and deployed into the device quickly.In this process, through the binding of modules, developers can flexibly combine functional modules based on their own application requirements, or delete, replace, and add some algorithm modules as required. All pipeline building work can be achieved through visualization or the configuration of a few lines of code, significantly reducing the time on developing the AI algorithm.In addition to vehicle scenarios, the Infer Studio™ development platform can also accelerate the process of algorithm compilation to application deployment for application scenarios such as object classification, face recognition, vehicle detection, and object segmentation, etc.What black technologies does NextVPU provide to support the ""one-click"" development experience on Infer Studio™?The Infer Studio™ development platform supports mainstream frameworks such as TensorFlow, TensorFlow Lite, ONNX, and Caffe so that developers can choose them as required. On the software layer, Infer Studio™ provides four function modules: Model Visualization, Compiler, Evaluator, and Debugger.The Model Visualization module can convert the complex code of the algorithm network on the PC side into a network diagram so that developers can analyze the structure and attributes of the network intuitively.The Compiler module can convert the algorithms developed based on the mainstream AI framework into files that can be read by AI chips, and complete the function of Compression at the same time. It further reduces the size of the algorithm model so that the algorithm can be deployed on the terminal devices with limited storage space, improving the network inference performance.In addition, Compiler supports optimization options such as operator fusion and precompilation, further enhancing the inference performance to AI chips.The Evaluator module can quickly evaluate whether an algorithm runs correctly on the AI chip and whether the chip's computing capability is fully utilized. In addition, it can visually present the algorithm effect of the network on the tested images through classification, detection, and segmentation.The Debugger module can efficiently analyze the deviation and compatibility problems that may be encountered in the process of algorithm porting from PC to the embedded system. Users can export data of each layer in the operation of the algorithm and compare it with the corresponding layer of the original algorithm so that errors can be found and debugged at any time.In addition, NextVPU provides technical support to customers according to their requirements in the implementation process of N1 series chips. ""We maintain a very close interaction with our customers, and we have integrated many of their requirements into our chips and software tools,"" Alan Feng said.4. Summary: Computer Vision Solutions with Hardware and Software IntegratedNextVPU, is originated from the meaning of ""Vision Power Unlimited"". In the surging wave of artificial intelligence, NextVPU is making its journey from computer vision to assume the role of ""empowering"" players in the fields of smart cameras, machine vision, ADAS and AIoT.As a core player in the field of AI chip design, NextVPU not only makes continuous breakthroughs in core technologies of AI chips, but also provides customers with ""one-click"" development tools for comprehensive product support from hardware to software. In addition to sharing NextVPU's thoughts on product design, Alan Feng pointed out that the computer vision market was still burgeoning, which means that computer vision chip companies like NextVPU cannot learn much experience from the industry but only explore and move forward on their own. It is expected that through the exploration of forerunners, such as NextVPU, AI vision can be applied in a wider range and help the industry improve quality and efficiency more significantly.SOURCE NextVPU"

Based on these criteria, four typical scenarios that demonstrate a real need for 5G include remote control, video backhaul, machine vision, and real-time positioning.Second, networks need to adapt to different scenarios. Networks are the foundation of competitive 5G services,More news about: Huawei","Huawei","SHANGHAI, Nov. 12, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- At the 11th Annual Mobile Broadband Forum today, Huawei's Deputy Chairman Ken Hu spoke with leaders in the telecoms and digital technology sectors about the new value that 5G can bring to different industries around the globe. As 5G is poised to transform the way we live, connect, and work, the telecoms sector is deeply invested in creating more value beyond the consumer market.Ken Hu speaks at 2020 MBBF""There's no out-of-the-box approach to innovation,"" said Hu on the topic of accelerating 5G application in industrial settings. ""We've got to focus on real needs in real scenarios – and build up the capabilities to meet those needs. This is a challenge. But more importantly, it's a huge opportunity for everyone involved.""Global 5G rollout is progressing quickly. As a leader in this domain, China has already seen over 600,000 base stations deployed in more than 300 cities, supporting more than 160 million 5G connections across the country. 5G services in China now deliver speeds in the hundreds of Mbps, and a wide array of 5G services have already been implemented in more than 20 domestic industries, including healthcare, ports, steel, power grids, mining, and manufacturing.""The adoption of 5G in industries has moved from technical verification to commercial deployment,"" Hu noted. ""As of September 30, 2020, China's three major operators have implemented over 5,000 innovative 5G projects and signed over 1,000 5G business contracts.""While expressing his full confidence in 5G's promising future with industries, Hu noted, ""There is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all solution, because every industry has vastly different requirements."" He shared four observations on the best ways to drive 5G innovation for industry applications.First, the industry needs to identify real needs based on specific business scenarios. While many industries have shown that they are ready and willing to embrace 5G, Hu stressed the need to develop a concrete set of criteria for specific scenarios and assess whether or not 5G is the right tool for the job: ""This is how we can identify the real needs that are worth investing in.""Huawei proposed four criteria for assessing real needs: technical relevance, business potential, value chain maturity, and standardization. Based on these criteria, four typical scenarios that demonstrate a real need for 5G include remote control, video backhaul, machine vision, and real-time positioning.Second, networks need to adapt to different scenarios. Networks are the foundation of competitive 5G services, so network equipment, together with network planning, construction, maintenance, and optimization, must be able to meet the requirements of an incredibly diverse range of industrial use cases. This requires operators and vendors to work together and keep innovating based on in-depth insight into industrial challenges.Third, a thriving industrial 5G device ecosystem is key. Huawei estimates that the average price of 5G modules will level out at around US$100 by the end of 2020, and hit US$40 by the end of 2022, which will greatly enrich the 5G device ecosystem.Fourth, telecoms operators need to develop new capabilities to serve business-facing 5G markets. 5G technology is a critical element in digital transformation, but it's not a full solution in and of itself. So beyond connectivity, telecoms service providers need to build a range of adjacent capabilities in areas like cloud operations, industry application development, and end-to-end system integration. At the moment, there is a noticeable lack of comprehensive solutions to meet these needs in the enterprise market.Telecoms operators are in a good position to provide these services. By focusing on connectivity, they can solidify their position as a connection provider in markets where existing network solutions are no longer sufficient. If they develop cloud and integration capabilities on top of that, operators can then provide a combination of connectivity, cloud, and integration services. Different roles have different capability requirements, and Huawei has doubled down on its commitment to helping carriers transform their portfolios as needed.""5G will create increasingly greater value for industries over the next decade,"" said Hu in closing. ""This means another period of rapid development for the telecoms industry. Moving forward, we will have to overcome a number of difficulties, and every step forward requires change. But I firmly believe that the hardest things are the things worth doing most. Because when you succeed, the results are incredible. We are ready and willing to work with operators, our enterprise customers, and industry partners to push the boundaries of innovation and build a better future for everyone.""At the 2020 Global Mobile Broadband Forum, Huawei will share insights into global industry trends and hot topics with carriers, regulators, partners, and media analysts from around the world. They will explore how innovation in ICT technologies such as 5G and AI can be mutually beneficial to industries and society at large.

The program offers streamlined, web-based tools to handle Department of Transportation (DOT) compliance needs and help fleets reduce compliance, safety, and accountability (CSA) violations.UniGroup is behind household goods carriers United Van Lines and Mayflower Transit""The DOT keeps us accountable to valuable guidelines that are essential to the safety of our drivers and others on the road,"" said Melissa Lawson, UniGroup's compliance director. ""With different branches of our business operating in different states, we have interstate and intrastate operations. We have drivers collecting data in different formats and according to different regulatory guidelines,"" Lawson said. ""Local drivers are using work statements to record their time, and some of our long-haul drivers are using paper logs while the majority of our drivers are using electronic logging devices to record their hours-of-service. Lytx will bring all this disparate data to one centralized location and make our records easier to manage and submit for DOT purposes.""Lytx's Hours of Service (HOS) solution was built with companies like UniGroup in mind. It can collect and integrate data from multiple sources, including electronic logging devices (ELDs), digital timesheets, paper logs, driver qualification documents, roadside inspections, and vehicle records. Lytx consolidates audit data from these multiple resources and analyzes the data through its Compliance Engine, looking for issues related to violations, falsifications, and non-compliance. All this information comes together on the Lytx dashboard to provide a clear picture of DOT compliance. Easing the Burden on Fleet Managers and Internal Compliance TeamsBecause Lytx stays current on DOT regulatory changes and is able to integrate those changes and requirements into its compliance solution on an ongoing basis, outsourcing this process to Lytx eases the burden on fleet managers and internal compliance teams, freeing time and resources to focus on other aspects of fleets' business. For companies like UniGroup, with thousands of vehicles and drivers nationwide, Lytx also works across many types of ELDs and can centralize that information to the Lytx dashboard regardless of ELD provider. ""If a driver's vehicle or ELD breaks down mid-trip, we can now be confident that their data will still synchronize with our central compliance platform, whether they need to replace the ELD with a different provider or go to a paper log,"" Lawson said. ""This takes a weight off both us and our drivers knowing that despite potential malfunctions or other technology challenges, we will still be able to monitor compliance with the regulations and help to ensure the safety of our drivers and the motoring public.""Beyond meeting regulatory requirements, Lytx Compliance Services also provides a clear view of what's causing violations impacting CSA scores, pinpointing the cause down to the driver level so targeted coaching and training can be applied where needed. Dashboard views rank drivers and locations, providing the information needed to coach drivers, reduce risk, help improve their performance and CSA scores.A web-based accident registry database and reporting system also helps record and store a fleet's DOT reportable crash history in a single, secure system, allowing fleets to add non-reportable incidents or accidents, tracking all damage and collision trends in a fleet's history.""We've worked with Lytx for over 15 years, using their team to process paper logs since 2004. Our Lytx team has always been incredibly responsive, supportive and flexible to our often-complex needs,"" Lawson said. ""Those years of outstanding service played a major role in our decision to sign on with Lytx Compliance Services, which will now automate many parts of the compliance process. We trust that they will always be there to pick up the phone and come through with what we need to do business well, serve our customers and stay compliant.""

(PRNewsfoto/Lytx)Using precise, cutting-edge technology, this new driver-powered approach to safety is a simple, but powerful way for drivers to be more proactive and accountable for their own improvement, while giving management the necessary visibility and data to effectively monitor and intervene if needed. The Next Generation of Driver-Powered SafetyLytx is adding a number of new capabilities to its safety offerings in support of this driver-powered approach, including:""Inattentive"" trigger, which uses proprietary machine vision and artificial intelligence (MV+AI) to detect when the driver's attention may be unfocused or the driver may be experiencing a condition such as fatigue or drowsiness without the reliance on an accelerometer event Real-time in-cab alerts for five different risky driving behaviors: cell phone use, eating and drinking, smoking, no seatbelt, speeding, and inattentiveness Behavior duration reporting, which uses MV+AI to track and quantify both the duration and percentage of drive time a driver was engaged in a risky driving behavior, providing a more holistic view of persistent riskWith these new MV+AI-powered updates, when an event is detected, the DriveCam® Event Recorder will issue a real-time in-cab alert to help drivers recognize and address their own risky behaviors and self-correct in the moment. Depending on the behavior, the alert will include a light and/or spoken phrase. With Lytx's ability to detect more than 60 driving behaviors with greater than 95% accuracy, its in-cab alerts are some of the most precise and actionable in the industry. Drivers will also have access to new check-in tools allowing them to review their own video and performance after-the-fact, including behavior duration. This gives a new perspective on past events and supports long-term retention on lessons learned during a drive. If desired, managers can stay informed by subscribing to push notifications and reports on pertinent information. ""Fleets today are looking for reliable technology that allows drivers to quickly improve in the moment and with little or no manager intervention,"" said Lytx President Doron Lurie. ""A driver-powered approach to safety empowers drivers to take charge of their own safety, while freeing up precious manager time that can be redirected to other areas of the business. Backed by award-winning technology and a proven strategy that has helped hundreds of thousands of drivers safely navigate billions of miles, fleet managers can be confident in this approach and can track progress along the way to respond to any critical events or incidents and intervene as needed."" Risk Detection Without Recording VideoLytx is also broadening its safety solutions with Risk Identification Without Recording, an innovative new configuration for its already best-in-class DriveCam Event Recorder. Using Lytx's ultra-precise MV+AI, DriveCam is now able to detect patterns of distracted or unwanted driving behaviors inside the cab without recording video of the driver.This new configuration is designed for fleets who opt to disable in-cab video recording, allowing them to benefit from significantly greater in-cab risk detection, while respecting driver privacy. Drivers can receive the added benefit of Lytx's expanded in-cab alerts based on risky behaviors that are detected, but not recorded, enabling in-the-moment action for greater safety overall. ""For more than 20 years, Lytx has made an unwavering commitment to developing cutting-edge technology, and we are continuously innovating to incorporate that technology for greater safety and productivity enhancements,"" said Lytx Chief Technology Officer Rajesh Rudraradhya. ""Leveraging our unmatched scale, deep expertise and advanced AI architecture, we have evolved from using AI to provide only video snippets and counts of risky driving behaviors to offering a full view of each and every drive with precise continual behavior reporting. The advanced driver first innovations announced today will help fleets and drivers identify and eradicate risk at levels never seen before, while ensuring every fleet can take advantage of the power of Lytx MV+AI to cut through the noise and focus on what matters.""These new capabilities announced today are part of Lytx's safety solutions and are configurable to suit each fleet's unique workflows and priorities. To learn more about driver-powered safety and see in-cab alerts in action, watch this new video.About Lytx MV+AIIn addition to inattentiveness, Lytx MV+AI can identify four other in-cab distracted or unwanted driving behaviors in real-time (handheld device, no seatbelt, food or drink, and driver smoking), as well as a number of road-view behaviors that are often indicative of distracted driving (lane departure, rolling stop, following distance, and critical distance). The algorithms and neural networks that power Lytx's MV+AI are based on more than 130 billion miles of driving data, representing the largest, fastest-growing proprietary database of its kind that is further enhanced by a rigorous system of professional event review. This ensures the information drivers and fleet managers receive both in the moment and post-trip cut through the noise and are as precise, relevant and actionable as possible.

With Deci's new deep learning platform, AI developers can achieve up to tenfold performance improvement on any task, be it machine vision, NLP, or audio, thus obtaining a significant competitive advantage.""Deci is leading a paradigm shift in AI to empower data scientists andMore news about: Deci","Deci","TEL AVIV, Israel, Oct. 27, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Deci, the deep learning company dedicated to transforming the AI lifecycle, today announced it has raised $9.1 million in a seed round led by Israel-based VC firm Emerge and global VC fund Square Peg. The company is building an AI-based platform that can automatically craft robust, scalable, and efficient deep neural network solutions ready for production at scale. Deci aims to help AI practitioners build the next generation of deep learning models.Advancements in AI, mainly powered by deep learning, have triggered groundbreaking innovations in medicine, manufacturing, transportation, communication, and retail. But, prolonged development cycles, high computing costs, and unsatisfying inference performance are making it nearly impossible for enterprises to productize AI. By harnessing AI to improve AI, Deci is automatically transforming models to be ready for effective production at scale. With Deci's new deep learning platform, AI developers can achieve up to tenfold performance improvement on any task, be it machine vision, NLP, or audio, thus obtaining a significant competitive advantage. ""Deci is leading a paradigm shift in AI to empower data scientists and deep learning engineers with the tools needed to create and deploy effective and powerful solutions,"" says Yonatan Geifman, CEO and co-founder of Deci. ""The rapidly increasing complexity and diversity of neural network models make it hard for companies to achieve top performance. We realized that the optimal strategy is to harness the AI itself to tackle this challenge. Using AI, Deci's goal is to help every AI practitioner to solve the world's most complex problems.""Deci's deep learning platform automatically gears up neural networks to become top-performing production-grade solutions on any hardware, including CPUs, GPUs, and special-purpose AI chips for edge and mobile. The platform is powered by Deci's patent-pending AutoNAC (Automated Neural Architecture Construction) technology, which uses machine learning to redesign any model and maximize its inference performance - all while preserving its accuracy. The platform optimizes any given deep learning model and cuts its computing costs for any desired hardware. ""In contrast to most classical machine learning algorithms, in deep learning, it's much easier to achieve shining out-of-sample accuracy with very large, over-parameterized, but very slow neural networks,"" said Professor Ran El-Yaniv, Deci's Chief Scientist, ""Our AutoNAC performs a smart high-speed search across a huge set of neural network architectures to aggressively speedup runtime, while preserving accuracy, by optimizing the fit between the neural network structure, the user's dataset, and the target computing hardware."" ""Runtime optimization for neural networks should always consider the target computing hardware,"" continues Geifman. ""It is quite surprising to some, but our hardware-aware AutoNAC optimization can do miracles even on general purpose chips like standard CPUs."" Last month, Deci submitted its inference results to MLPerf, the industrial standardized benchmark suite for measuring deep learning performance. On several popular Intel CPUs, Deci accelerated the inference speed of the well-known ResNet neural network by 11.8x while meeting the MLPerf accuracy target. An acceleration of this magnitude closes the gap between the latency of inference on CPU and standard GPUs. This is a significant step towards enabling deep learning inference on millions of available CPUs, both on cloud, enterprise data centers, and edge devices. Deci promises to expose speedups for GPUs by applying its AutoNAC sledgehammer for its next MLPerf submissions.Deci has already partnered with numerous industry leaders in autonomous vehicles, manufacturing, communication, video and image editing, healthcare, hardware, and system OEMs. One of Deci's success stories includes an impressive 4.6x acceleration of a state-of-the-art model for a complex machine vision task. This boost enabled a 78% reduction in the computing costs by allowing for the same production capacity using fewer GPUs.""Deci's ability to automatically craft top-performing deep learning solutions is a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence and unlocks new opportunities for many businesses across different industries,"" said Liad Rubin, Partner at Emerge. ""We are proud to have partnered with such incredible founders and be part of Deci's journey from day one.״""It was clear to us that Deci has a highly innovative product that allows businesses to fully utilize their AI potential, but what sealed the deal for us was its people,"" said Philippe Schwartz, Partner at Square Peg. ""We haven't seen such an experienced and driven team in this space and are sure they will only progress from here, innovating industries across the board.""Deci was co-founded by deep learning scientist Yonatan Geifman, PhD, together with technology entrepreneur Jonathan Elial, and professor Ran El-Yaniv, a computer scientist and machine learning expert from the Henry and Marilyn Taub Faculty of Computer Science at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. Deci has already recruited a core team of top-notch deep learning engineers and scientists, with vast experience in elite organizations and universities.
